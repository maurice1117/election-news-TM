PoliticalDiscussion,1gi79lt,Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell acknowledges that Trump killed the biggest border security bill in decades so he could campaign on the issue instead. What will this mean for the election?,"Link to his words on it: * https://x.com/harris_wins/status/1848005868320702568 And here's a link to the bill being killed earlier this year: * https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-republicans-block-border-security-bill-campaign-border-chaos-rcna153607 McConnell had given the green light for James Lankford, a conservative Republican, to negotiate a comprehensive border security package with Democrats led by Kyrsten Sinema, a moderate border state Senator from Arizona. The final package was agreed to by all parties and signed off on by McConnell as well as Democratic leaders before Trump publicly came out against it and urged his allies in the House and Senate GOP to kill it. The reason, according to widespread reporting including the above, was that he wanted to run his campaign on there being chaos at the border and him being the solution to fix it, and he worried that the proposed bill would resolve the problem and deprive him of something to run on. Since then, Trump has made immigration and the idea of a border crises the central point of his campaign. He's gone to every border state to rant about it and lambast Democrats for not fixing it. He's brought it up in every appearance, at every interview, at the presidential debate. He's tied the border to false stories about migrants coming over to eat people's pets. He brings it up at every rally. Yet it was he himself who worked to ensure that it wasn't fixed, and now his own party's Senate leader acknowledges it. What sort of impact do you think this will have on the election? Will it move voters? Will people see the truth behind the dynamic?

PoliticalDiscussion,1et5yej,"Since Biden dropped out, according to the polls almost all the 3rd party/undecided voters have gone to Harris instead of splitting evenly. Why did this happen?","Whether the poll averages are from 538, Real Clear Politics, or Nate Silver, when Biden dropped out, Trump had a decent lead on the president and even on Harris, although tentatively, since she wasn't the Democratic candidate at the time. However, since that event, nearly all of the 3rd party/undecided vote have moved to Harris with Trump staying about the same as he was or slipping a point. If Trump was up 45-42 on Biden and Harris on July 22, now Trump is still around 45 with Harris at 47. That would mean that as the 3rd party/undecided vote fell, Harris benefited by scooping up the vast majority of those who either preferred third party or were undecided (ignoring non-voters). Trump didn't maintain his edge over Harris since the movable vote didn't split between him and her. Why do you think that most of the third party and undecided vote moved to Harris rather than splitting their votes? Is it just because Harris is new despite the fact that most voters disapproved of Harris as VP before she became the nominee? Can Harris get away with not answering reporters' questions or sitting for an interview? Did Trump stumble by not focusing his attack on her left-wing record? Did the Trump campaign misfire by arguing over Walz's military record/stolen valor claims as they aren't dispositive to voters' concerns?

What are your thoughts on this? How does it change the dynamic of the race?","Link to his comments here: * https://x.com/KamalaHQ/status/1821628225174245869 Up to now, Republicans have been running an election cycle about abortion where they say they will not pursue a national ban in Congress, and to leave legislative action to the states. However, Trump may have opened the door to a national discussion about the various other ways Republicans could severely limit abortion access nationwide without congress or new legislative action. One of these ways is through the FDA. Previously, FDA authorization of Mifepristone aka the abortion pill couldn't be rolled back due to the protections of Roe v. Wade. However, with Roe gone and thus abortion no longer protected nationally thanks to Trump's own Supreme Court appointees, Trump is now free to install any zealot, radical or fundamentalist he chooses as head of the Department of Health and Human Services **(HHS)**, the Food and Drug Administration **(FDA)** and others to pursue federal action like this, as a lot of the remaining means to protect or curtail access go through these types of agencies. This can function as an alternative to having to muscle through a new nationwide abortion ban through Congress, and allows you to campaign on ""leaving it to the states"" while knowing you'll have various levers to pull to ban or restrict it nationally anyways once in office that the average citizen might not be aware of. With Trump seemingly letting the cat out of the bag, how does it impact the elections, both presidential and downballot?

PoliticalDiscussion,1bjwyai,"House Republicans have unveiled their 2025 agenda. It includes a full endorsement of the Life At Conception Act, which would ban all abortions and IVF access nationwide, rolling back the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare) and raising the Social Security retirement age. What are your thoughts on it?","It was created and is endorsed by the Republican Study Committee (RSC), the largest bloc of House Republicans that includes over 170 members including House Speaker Mike Johnson and his entire leadership team. The Life at Conception Act is particularly notable because a state version of 'Life at Conception' is what led to the Alabama Supreme Court banning IVF a few weeks ago. Some analysts believe the Florida Supreme Court could try something similar soon. So it looks like Republicans could be using some of these states to sort of test run the perfect language they could then apply to a national ban. Another interesting point is that Republicans are filing all these things under a 'budget' proposal. This could be because budgetary items can bypass the Senate Filibuster (the minority party veto that the GOP enjoy using when out of power). Special exemptions past it apply to budgets, so all they'd need to do is clear it with the Senate Parliamentarian and they could jam it home with 1-seat majorities in the House and Senate + Trump to sign. And if the parliamentarian says no, they can just fire and replace her with anyone they want. Republicans have a history of doing just this, most recently in 2001.

PoliticalDiscussion,1el68d9,What happens to MAGA assuming a Trump loss in November?,"A few premises: * Right-wing extremism in the U.S. began to be mainstream before Trump's rise to power, around the time of the Tea Party movement. Thus the Tea Party, QAnon, MAGA, separatist militias, etc. can all be seen as facets of the same phenomenon. * Particularly with QAnon and MAGA, binding forces appear to include worship of a charismatic leader, together with a shared system of false beliefs (in characteristics of the leader, prophecies of future events e.g. ""Trump is about to imprison his enemies"", etc.). * If those beliefs are shown to be false in a way impossible to ignore, as with QAnon's deadlines which never happened, the spell may be broken. * Another way of looking at MAGA is as a unifying political orientation similar to McCarthyism, where negative behaviors such as bullying are embraced purely out of herd mentality and fear of loss of position. In some cases, like McCarthyism, there comes a tipping point, an emperor-without-clothes moment where the binding forces are dissipated based purely upon a shift in the balance of power. * There have been attempts, so far unsuccessful, at achieving such a tipping point with Trumpism. * Extremists can be fickle. Witness, for instance, the anger and disillusionment of the Proud Boys and others when Trump failed to mount a larger-scale insurrection. This may be triggered by an event or decision which punctures a belief about the charismatic leader, such as about the leader's [**bravery**](https://newrepublic.com/post/184540/donald-trump-fans-kamala-harris-debate). Thus the question is about an interesting balance of forces in MAGA/Trumpism: beliefs in superhuman qualities of Trump coupled with false facts about the opposition, but opposed by real-world facts and increasing unease about November, the latter of which seem to be emboldening the never-Trump wing of the Republican party (see Republicans for Harris and many others). The balance might present a possibility that a Trump loss in November would begin to cleanse the Republican party of Trumpism for good. However, barring some deprogramming of the MAGA base, there might also be a pathological result: denials of the election worse than before, accompanied by unrest and violence. ETA: I've realized, based on the comments (excellent), that the conversation is about both short- and long-term effects. I agree that it's a complex question that deserves to be further broken down. **TL;DR:** **What's likely in the short term after a Trump loss in November?** 1. A punctured balloon as with the end of McCarthyism, and a return to relative normalcy, OR 2. Worsening civil unrest due to ongoing radicalization? **What are the longer-term impacts of a Trump loss?** * The Republican party corrects by abandoning Trumpism, having finally realized it's causing a massive loss of power * within a single election cycle? * over a longer period, such as a generation?

What we learned that's new, is just how extensive and deep the relationship was between the National Inquirer, Trump and his business / campaign team. It was revealed that going back to the GOP Primary in 2015, The National Inquirer on a daily basis, manufactured false stories on every GOP candidate, from Marco Rubio to Ted Cruz as a character assasination technique. Articles were reviewed by Michael Cohen and Trump himself before being released on the cover of a newspaper that was arguably the most viewed by Americans in grocery stores on a daily basis. Anything negative would be squashed by the newspaper and not allowed to be released as requested until after the 2016 election. In recent history, there has never been a case where an entire Newspaper was working for a single candidate of any party to this extent.

Democrats may also have an opportunity to put their own candidate \[Jeffries\] forward which could result in change of power, though some Democrats have stated they may rescue Johnson. Massie, in a brief Capitol Hill interview, suggested: We want Mike Johnson to resign. We don't want to go speaker-less. So, the goal is to show him, through co-sponsorship, how much support he's lost and hopefully he'll get the message and give us a notice so that we have time ... to replace him.

PoliticalDiscussion,1es5r0t,"As the polling shows Harris increasing her lead, should she expand her campaign to more battleground states or focus on the tipping point states?","The 2024 election will likely come down to a handful of tipping point states. These include PA, WI, and NV. Most importantly out of all of them, and the most likely tipping point state, is Pennsylvania. But as Harris?™s lead has continued to grow, more states have come back into play and are considered battle ground states, including GA, AZ, and NC. Some polling has also suggested some competitiveness in TX and FL. Michigan also is considered a battle ground state but remains on the Democrat leaning side of the tipping point states. With a candidate who is still introducing herself to new voters and with a finite amount of resources and time, should Harris focus on the tipping point states since that?™s all that is needed to win or should she expanding her campaign to cover all battle ground states? Reasons to focus on the tipping point states are because those will most likely win you the election. There is only so much money and time and Harris doesn?™t want to lose these states. As Biden lost ground in the polls there were questions on whether he should campaign in states that became competitive like NM and VA but at that point if he?™s losing that much then the race is already lost. Reasons to focus on battle ground states include polling error and shifts in the race. Harris is leading in WI but that state has been notoriously difficult to poll with very high polling errors. This could be true for any state. Harris does not want to get caught like Hillary not campaigning in a state that she thought was completely safe only based on polls. Also for coat tail reasons. If Harris can help other democrats gets over the finish line in more states, the better.

PoliticalDiscussion,1gnesig,What are your thoughts on a purge of senior military by the incoming Trump administration?,"On the prospect of a purge of top generals and admirals by the incoming Trump administration, to ensure personal loyalty to him.... This matter has been debated frequently on Reddit. However, I have some niche experience in this realm, having helped maintain Wikipedia's articles listing [four-star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_active_duty_United_States_four-star_officers) (admirals and generals) and [three-star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_active_duty_United_States_three-star_officers) (vice admirals and lieutenant generals) officers in the United States military since late 2020. Military officer appointment procedures stem from the [Defense Officer Personnel Management Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Officer_Personnel_Management_Act) (DOPMA), passed in 1980, and are codified in Title 10 of the [United States Code](https://uscode.house.gov/browse/&edition=prelim). When the Armed Services committees pass their yearly defense authorisation bill, any changes demanded of the military consist of updates to Title 10. Officers are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. While the military is *supposed* to be apolitical, senior officers can, and have been, removed at the President's pleasure. After all, ultimately, *the President decides who they want to work with, and senior officers are vetted partially on how well they could work with the commander in chief.* Recent removals have occurred when the individual expresses open disagreement with the commander in chief, makes severe public gaffes, or are unlucky enough to commit professional incompetence ([Moseley 2008](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-undoing-of-gen-t-mich_b_238432), [McChrystal 2010](https://www.bbc.com/news/10395402), [Mattis 2013](https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/01/18/the-obama-administrations-inexplicable-mishandling-of-marine-gen-james-mattis-2/)). Since the main duty of senior officers outside command is to present honest military advice to the commander-in-chief, and to Congress, relieving them before the end of their assignments is unexpected and risks the wrath of their retired colleagues and their supporters in Congress. Before I enter my initial opinions for discussion, here are some stats (accurate as of 9 November 2024). Of the four-star officers currently on active duty (44 in total): 1. **9** are African-American (including Chairman of the Joint Chiefs [CQ Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Q._Brown_Jr), the principal military advisor to the President). 2. **6** were initially promoted to four-star general or admiral under the Trump administration (one, [GEN LaCamera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_LaCamera), is retiring with a Senate-confirmed successor already in place). 3. **3** are women, all initially appointed by the Biden administration, and the first woman appointed to each of their roles, received a lot of publicity ([ADMs Franchetti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Franchetti), [Fagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_L._Fagan), and [Levine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Levine)). 4. **1** serves in a non-military political office that can hold the rank of admiral in the Public Health Service if desired ([ADM Levine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Levine), the first openly transgender person to hold the rank of admiral). Here is what I surmise based on my personal experience, and what other articles have already stated: * The incoming administration will target generals and admirals too closely identified with their predecessor's DEI initiatives. Here are the most likely departures: * ADM Levine, who isn't technically military, serves in a political role (Assistant Secretary for Health) and only holds military rank to outrank the [three-star surgeon general](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivek_Murthy), is easily the first one out. * Gen Brown, [chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairman_of_the_Joint_Chiefs_of_Staff). [George Floyd](https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/charlesqbrownongeorgefloydcivilunrest.htm) (iykyk). The chairman of the Joint Chiefs served a 2-year term by law, typically renewed once by the President with Senate confirmation, until it was changed in 2017 to an uninterrupted 4-year term. Brown may simply be relieved prematurely at his 2-year halfway mark, October 2025. * ADM Franchetti, the first woman to be [chief of naval operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_Naval_Operations) (head of the Navy). Her selection as the CNO was highly publicized, following the 2021 promotions of [GEN Richardson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_J._Richardson), [Gen Van Ovost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacqueline_Van_Ovost), and ADM Fagan (Richardson and Van Ovost have retired). However, the President made the call to [choose Franchetti](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lisa-franchetti-nominated-first-woman-navy-joint-chiefs-of-staff/), [overruling the DOD's pick](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/06/12/paparo-franchetti-austin-navy-00101594), thus giving the incoming administration a possible opening. * For those worrying about blatantly ""Trumpist"" generals being appointed, I don't see that happening without a sudden culture shift in the military. Not soon, anyway. * For starters, the tradition that the military stay out of partisan politics is sacrosanct. I haven't seen any recent cases where an active duty military officer (including [LTG Mike Flynn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Flynn)) paraded around any partisan leanings. While the military's values typically lean traditional Republican, open loyalty to a President typically shows only after retirement. * If the President-elect is serious about appointing ""loyal"" officers to senior military roles, he'll have to comb the lower ranks. [Title 10, Section 601](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/601) of the U.S. Code stipulates that only one-star officers and above can be promoted to general or admiral, so the maximum he could do is promote colonels and Navy captains to one-star ranks and begin choosing from there. * On the ""culture shift"", open, public loyalty to a President from the upper military brass (the kind we likely worry about) will only show once the practice becomes either legally acceptable or murky enough on paper to no longer be important. * To dismiss disloyal officers and comb the lower ranks for desired ones will likely require a special commission to investigate. The military officers and DOD professionals (smth smth [Schedule F](https://protectdemocracy.org/work/trumps-schedule-f-plan-explained/)) in charge of vetting prospective senior officers for the secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, JCS chairman, Secretary of Defense and President would have no clue on how to select based on the ""loyalty"" the President-elect desires. * The President, and allied defense advisors, may try to replace DOPMA or loosen its requirements so officers from lower ranks can be promoted faster to reach the upper brass, or increase the maximum retirement age of 64 to keep favoured officers for as long as possible (not unheard of - [the DOD under Rumsfeld tried to increase it to 72](https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=mUqr4c4-VXMC&pg=PA1491&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false)). Senate confirmation will remain part of the process, but a pliant majority until at least 2027 should make it a breeze. r/Military focuses on topics like military pay, veterans' benefits, the state of military barracks, and on the political side, how the incoming administration will affect the willingness of the rank-and-file to continue military service. This community often provides more analytical insights, so I look forward to it. Once again, this matter has been debated frequently in other areas on Reddit, but I hope I've provided additional insight so productive responses are forthcoming. Maybe there's cause for concern, maybe there isn't - i.e. only a few officers will see termination. We won't know until he takes office. What do you think? P.S. Sorry if I sound abrasive in this post. I've been described as having a stiff and formal manner of speaking. P.P.S. The military being used for partisan purposes with a purge of senior officers is inherently a political matter. The jargon-heavy nature of this post hopefully doesn't change that. P.P.P.S. If this question looks partisan in any way whatsoever, I apologise and am welcome to receive comments on how I can reword portions to be less disparaging in nature. **Sources:** * [Pentagon anticipates major upheaval with Trump?™s return to White House](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/11/07/trump-military-pentagon/) * [Pentagon officials anxious Trump may fire the military?™s top general](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/08/pentagon-trump-fire-cq-brown-00188536) * [Trump may further test US military norms in second term](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/trump-may-further-test-us-103848814.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJqlR_aGl96mZC_C8cWCysgr-4KIYRg-6c9YlCYN4LwjNBoy3lcPjkbGd3mZaBra5tRwoeImhrekyHSBuARDOaVxAo2b0yEEfdLCBMcJiGiRiIZExHKIY4fSbghBzW-rUCKQ-akYkQ22B0aj2QYjtGflCxuuqBj27Rd9ALcw3QFA) * [Legislative history of United States four-star officers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislative_history_of_United_States_four-star_officers) (Wikipedia article - this is a TL;DR, there are individual articles for certain eras which one should read if time permits)",SuperWIKI1,2024/11/10 01:11,583,559,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1gnesig/what_are_your_thoughts_on_a_purge_of_senior/,https://reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1gnesig/what_are_your_thoughts_on_a_purge_of_senior/,,,,,,,

We all remember January 6, 2021, when a violent mob stormed the Capitol. This event didn?™t just happen out of the blue?”Trump?™s rhetoric played a significant role in inciting it. In the days leading up to January 6, Trump repeatedly claimed the election was stolen, despite no evidence supporting these claims. During his speech on January 6, Trump told his supporters: ?œWe fight like hell. And if you don?™t fight like hell, you?™re not going to have a country anymore?? During the 2024 Republican National Convention (RNC), several speeches highlighted the intense rhetoric surrounding the election. Donald Trump, after accepting the GOP nomination, made a passionate speech where he described himself as a fighter against a corrupt establishment. He warned of ?œchaos and destruction??if he wasn?™t re-elected, framing the 2024 election as a battle for the soul of America. Republican leaders also echoed this combative tone. J.D. Vance, the vice presidential nominee, emphasized his alignment with Trump, warning of the need to ?œfight??against perceived threats to American values. These speeches collectively built a narrative of urgency and confrontation, which could fuel concerns about potential unrest if Trump loses in 2024. As the 2024 election approaches, the rhetoric from Trump and his supporters has intensified, with some openly threatening violence if he loses. On Truth Social, users have expressed their willingness to take drastic actions, with comments like, ?œIf they steal the election again, we won?™t just march on the Capitol, we?™ll take our country back by any means necessary.??Given these statements and the current political climate, do you think we?™re at risk of another January 6-style event or even a civil war if Trump loses in 2024?

Chuck Schumer (D-NY) when he retires?,"Background: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a member of the United States House of Representatives for the state of New York. She belongs to the Democratic Party. She was first elected during the 2018 midterms and has handily won reelection in 2020, 2022 and 2024. She serves on The Committee of Oversight and Reform, which is the main investigative committee in the House. In January 2023, she was selected as the Vice Ranking Member ??the #2 spot for Democrats on the committee. She also serves as a first-time member on The Committee on Natural Resources and as Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources. Since her first election, she has become one of the most high-profile Democrats in the House. She is considered a left-wing Democrat. She is 35 years old. Chuck Schumer is a member of the United States Senate, the senior senator from New York, and the current Majority Leader and Chair of the Senate Democratic Caucus. He was first elected to the Senate in the 1998 midterms, and has won reelection four times. Prior to that, he was a member of the House of Representatives for the state of New York, first elected in 1980. Schumer has served on numerous committees and other official functions in both the House and the Senate. He is 74 years old. It is widely agreed that Schumer cannot be primaried, due to his popularity and political longevity. Prospective contenders will have to wait until he leaves office. Schumer does not plan to retire at the moment. New York has been a blue state for decades. Whoever the Democratic candidate is, is expected to be elected. Therefore, the real contest will be the Democratic primary, not the election. Schumer ascended to the Senate from the House. If he chooses to retire when his term is up, in 2028, AOC will then have 10 years of experience in the House and be 39, which would make her a good contender to succeed him. However, questions remain about her ability to widen her appeal from New York's 14th Congressional District to the entire state. Roughly 64% of the state's population lives in the New York City metropolitan area and 40% in New York City alone.

While I broadly understand that media fearmongering and the GOP political machine has an incentive to convince the public to be anti-immigration, and will fuel moot points even if they're not backed by statistics, but why hasn't the statistical truth broken through this threshold? Immigration was 2# in voters issues and why they voted for Trump instead of Harris. Even a large number of Latino voters, a community that are overwhelmingly immigrant related, voted for Trump for this same reason. While its understandable that immigrants also have the mentality of ""deport criminals, keep the hard working ones"" just as Americans do, the fact that a large portion of the populace associates high immigration with high crime is still unexplainable to me. And also; how much of this is the fault of Harris' campaign oversight? As well as DNC negligence. Similar to the economy, we have a situation here where statistics and data shows that immigration and the economy are doing good, but unlike the economy, immigration crime doesn't at all affect most Americans, there's just a perception that isn't even truly there. The Harris campaign could've flagshipped ""immigrants commit less crimes than citizens, also they're good for reducing inflation"", yet didn't. So how are these numbers of the positives of immigration not at all mainstream? People are still espouting myths of immigration crime and their impacts of the economy, I'm shocked that numbers-based facts haven't been shown to the public to say ""hey guys, we hear you, but all of your concerns would be fixed if we legalized them and taxed them more. I PROMISE you guys, immigrants are not increasing crime in this country, the FBI has the numbers to back this up."" This should've been the flagship and the Harris Campaign could've equally spent time educating the public about the truth of immigration. Yet that didn't seem to be the case. So I have to ask: why aren't these facts commonplace? For what reason is it that the DNC never articulated and lead with immigration statistics when convincing the public that immigration is not the problem? **Edit:** Several people without reading this post are trying to correct me by saying ""illegal immigrants commit more crimes, pundits are referring to illegal immigrants when they talk about the high immigration crime."" Please reconsider posting if you intend on being confidently incorrect and haven't even read this post.

PoliticalDiscussion,1gmlex2,"What happens if President Trump and the republicans pass federal laws that force states to do/behave certain way, and Democratic states refuse to follow federal laws?","We live in a divided country and the republicans and democrats have wildly different visions for the future. Some of those decisions are very personal. Of course Trump won the election. And Trump has the backing of SCOTUS, which gave him absolute immunity as president. It?™s also very likely that Republicans will have control over all three branches of government - all of Congress (senate and house), presidency and SCOTUS. Even if some of the lower courts argue and can?™t decide over issues, it will go up to the Trump-friendly SCOTUS. What happens then if Trump and the Republicans, realizing how much power they have, act boldly and pass federal laws forcing all states to follow new controversial laws, that affect people personally. For example, abortion. I would imagine it would play out in the courts until it makes its way to SCOTUS. Usually this particular SCOTUS always sides with state autonomy, when issues between federal and state are presented before them. But they also have been known to not follow precedent, even their own when it suits them. So what happens if SCOTUS rules with the Republican majority and instructs all states to follow new federal abortion laws, for example. And what happens if blue states, like New York, refuse to follow these new federal laws or abide by SCOTUS ruling? Does Trump send the military to New York? Arrest Gov Hochul and NY AG James? Does New York send its own forces to protect its NY Gov and AG?

Nothing has happened, to my knowledge, that would cause people to rally around him, and Harris hasn't found herself at the center of any notable scandals. It seems, dare I say, entirely artificial or even manufactured. But I have no proof of such a thing. 2.

What evidence exists the he won?™t do so again?,"I've been thinking through this after seeing endless amounts of highly upvoted posts touting some new poll showing Harris pulling away. 3 major election models all show Harris as a slight favorite. (538, economist, Nate Silver's model at his sub stack) and Silver has at least said at this point he'd rather be Harris with the polls he is seeing. However we have two very clear data points with Trump on the ballot. In 2016 Trump pulled off a win when almost no one thought he had a chance. And in 2020 Biden had a clear win, but it ended up being *far* closer than the polls. In fact, projections the day before the election were that Biden would score pretty comfortable wins in the Blue wall and also pick up wins in FL and NC. Reviewing the polls of FL in particular shows Biden consistently being up 3-6 points. https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/ For reference here is the final 538 projection but to summarize it gave Biden a 90% chance to win with likely wins in FL and NC and Iowa and TX being closish. Biden ended up losing FL pretty convincingly, and the polls were off by a good 5 points or so. Currently, all polling seems to show a super narrow Harris lead, often within the margin of error, even in the Blue wall states and Trump with clear leads in AZ, FL and more of a toss up in GA and NC. My question is: Is there any objective reason or evidence to believe the polls are *not* once again underestimating Trump's support? They have under called Trump's vote by 3-5 points twice so far, why won't it happen again?

PoliticalDiscussion,1fc7ptr,"Will Lt. Gov Robinson's ""Pizza box in the booth"" scandal cost Trump NC and as a result the 2024 election? (The guy Trump called the next MLK)","Relative to Biden, Harris has surged in the swing states where non-white voters are above the national average of 33% (NC, GA, NV) (See YouTubelink below) in a manner few predicted back in July. Perhaps they should have? Georgia in 2024 is on the cusp of reaching 40% non-white voters and North Carolina is just shy of doubling Michigan and Pennsylvania non-white voters. GA and NC may well see record turnout 16 years into significant demographic changes extremely favorable to Democrats since Obama's 2008 NC win where there are now one Democrat Governor and 2 Democrat Southern Senators (compared to zero in Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee). Some people thought this was a 2020/2021 fluke but the demographic trends says otherwise. With Non-white voters racing towards 40% of the population in two critical-for-270 swing states and an only 1% NC Republican margin of victory in a high 2020 turnout election (where an African American was not on the top of the ticket like there will be this time) is the sort of playing field that becomes very susceptible to a political last straw that swings just enough independents to join the Democrat coalition. That last straw for independents may be the latest of many controversies surrounding the MAGA lieutenant governor Mark Robinson (who Trump compared to Dr. Martin Luther King) and has undoubtedly brought more embarrassing national attention to the NC governor's race. If you missed the coverage the anti LBGT Republican who prefers the era where women couldn't vote (his own recent words), has repeated Adolf H and has dabbeld in holocaust denial, was indetified by former employees of adult stores for spending approximately $150 a week in adult movies, visiting as many as five times a week and often bringing his own box of pizza into the ""private booths"" where most faith based conservatives lieutenant governors are rarely present. Given the thread bare margins that may be coming with our only second ever nominated African American presidential candidate and how NC moderates and centrists may want to send a message to Trump and his endorsed NC GOP candidate, an endorsement that came AFTER the lieutenant governor called LBGTQ citizens ""maggots and filth"". Is there a political last straw that swings just enough independents to put Harris ahead in NC and GA? Recall Hershel Walker's comments and the controversies of his political circles (the Matt Schlapp incident) costing Trump Georgia? If Harris were to indeed flip Georgia which was famously decided by 11,779 votes or 0.23% in 2020 and Robinson ends up costing Trump North Carolina by crossing the independent voter ick threshold, then Harris lands at 283 electoral votes even with losing Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona. Curiously, the 2016 NC governor's race that defeated a Republican governor was decided by a very similar to Georgia 0.22% of the vote.. whereas the 2020 election of Roy Cooper with Trump again on the ballot (pre January 6th attack) was decided by 4.5% in favor of the NC Democrat.

PoliticalDiscussion,1dsufsu,Supreme Court holds Trump does not enjoy blanket immunity from prosecution for criminal acts committed while in office. Although Trump's New York 34 count indictment help him raise additional funds it may have alienated some voters. Is this decision more likely to help or hurt Trump?,"Held: Under our constitutional structure of separated powers, the nature of Presidential power entitles a former President to absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for actions within his conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority. And he is entitled to at least presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official acts. There is no immunity for unofficial acts. Pp. 5??3 Earlier in February 2024, a unanimous panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected the former president's argument that he has ""absolute immunity"" from prosecution for acts performed while in office. ""Presidential immunity against federal indictment would mean that, as to the president, the Congress could not legislate, the executive could not prosecute and the judiciary could not review,"" the judges ruled. ""We cannot accept that the office of the presidency places its former occupants above the law for all time thereafter."" During the oral arguments in April of 2024 before the U.S. Supreme Court; Trump urged the high court to accept his rather sweeping immunity argument, asserting that a president has absolute immunity for official acts while in office, and that this immunity applies after leaving office. Trump's counsel argued the protections cover his efforts to prevent the transfer of power after he lost the 2020 election. Additionally, they also maintained that a blanket immunity was essential because otherwise it could weaken the office of the president itself by hamstringing office holders from making decisions wondering which actions may lead to future prosecutions. Special counsel Jack Smith had argued that only sitting presidents enjoy immunity from criminal prosecution and that the broad scope Trump proposes would give a free pass for criminal conduct. Although Trump's New York 34 count indictment help him raise additional funds it may have alienated some voters. Is this decision more likely to help or hurt Trump as the case further develops?

PoliticalDiscussion,1gp56t4,How likely is Trump to convert the US to a totalitarian dictatorship?,"There has been a lot of talk about what limitations Trump will or will not face in imposing his will on America. Some say he will fundamentally transform America into a totalitarian hellscape; others say Trump will be considerably more restrained, if not constrained. There appears to be a spectrum of opinions. I'll set them forth below. **Extreme One** > Trump faces no practical limitations anymore. He will be able to stack every facet of the government with sufficient loyalists that he will be able to do literally anything he wants. If he wants to, he could force everyone to hang a painting of himself in their house and have them executed if the painting is damaged. Even if there are laws that prohibit something, Trump will have the power to change or, perhaps worse, simply ignore them because nobody will stand in his way. Those who do stand in his way will be removed from his path, likely brutally. America will transform into an Orwellian nightmare where every device is listening to ensure anyone who so much as whispers something criticism-adjacent will be shot. There will be sham elections in which Trump receives 100% of the vote every time while simultaneously anyone who votes against Trump is literally thrown to a pack of wolves to be ripped apart. **Middle Position** > Trump will face some obstacles in trying to implement loony policies. The SCOTUS/Congress/Military would prevent him from mandating really horrifying stuff like what is being suggested above. That being said, many of his policies, such as abolishing the Department of Education, imposing tariffs, and so on, will sail on through. There could be fair and free elections in the future. **Extreme Two** > Trump will be a far right president, but nothing more. Democracy will survive, even if Democrats will have a whole lot to complain about. Perhaps the federal bureaucracy is turned to Trump's whims, perhaps it's not; but we will have the rule of law, and we will have fair and free elections moving forward. If a Republican loses in 2028, then a Democrat will become president. How likely are each of these three positions to occur? Are all of them incorrect?

Does this look like it gave Trump only a temporarily reprieve depending on how the court may rule on his immunity argument from prosecution currently pending?,"A five-justice majority ??Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh ??wrote that states may not remove any federal officer from the ballot, especially the president, without Congress first passing legislation. ?œWe conclude that States may disqualify persons holding or attempting to hold state office. But States have no power under the Constitution to enforce Section 3 with respect to federal offices, especially the Presidency,??the opinion states. ?œNothing in the Constitution delegates to the States any power to enforce Section 3 against federal officeholders and candidates,??the majority added. Majority noted that states cannot act without Congress first passing legislation. The issue before the court involved the Colorado Supreme Court on whether states can use the anti-insurrectionist provision of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution to keep former President Donald Trump off the primary ballot. Colorado found it can. Although the court was unanimous on the idea that Trump could not be unilaterally removed from the ballot. The justices were divided about how broadly the decision would sweep. A 5-4 majority said that no state could dump a federal candidate off any ballot ??but four justices asserted that the court should have limited its opinion. Section 3 of the 14th Amendment at issue was enacted after the Civil War to bar from office those who engaged in insurrection after previously promising to support the Constitution. Trump's lawyer told the court the Jan. 6 events were a riot, not an insurrection. ?œThe events were shameful, criminal, violent, all of those things, but it did not qualify as insurrection as that term is used in Section 3,"" attorney Jonathan Mitchell said during oral arguments.

In another related case, the justices agreed last week to decide if Trump can be criminally tried for trying to steal the 2020 election.

So why did the Trump threat to democracy not affect Trump voters? Do most Trump voters just not care about democracy all that much? Data from [exit polls](https://apnews.com/article/democracy-harris-trump-threats-authoritarianism-election-2024-56b4eb981f34f3e60aec1e45a67fc8a2) suggests that many voters for both Trump and Harris said their vote choice was motivated strongly by appeals to defend democracy. This was the number one reason for most Harris voters, but it was also the first or second most important reason cited for many Trump voters. Surveys also suggest [similar](https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/48238-most-americans-support-democracy-and-oppose-dictatorship) levels of support for democracy among Democrats and Republicans. However, it is possible that Trump voters are not as committed to democracy even if they say it matters to them in surveys. Another possibility is that Trump and Harris supporters just think democracy means different things, and Trump's actions are consistent with how Trump supporters think about democracy. Social science research suggests Republicans and Democrats understand democracy to mean [the same thing](https://theconversation.com/how-different-people-around-the-world-understand-democracy-and-why-it-matters-241617): free and fair elections and political freedoms like free speech. But maybe when you drill down into the details, Trump supporters have different ideas about what makes an election free and fair or which freedoms should be defended. It could also be the case that Trump convinced his supporters he is the one defending democracy. If they believe the election in 2020 really was stolen from him, that Democrats are letting immigrants vote for them illegally, and that Trump's prosecutions were political retribution, they might accept the narrative that Trump was persecuted by a corrupt and authoritarian Democratic party. But maybe these beliefs are not deeply held and are just claims made to justify their political project, for which democracy doesn't matter all that much. Is there another possibility I am missing?

PoliticalDiscussion,1fpwf37,"Rank Choice Voting (RCV) has been proposed as a way to reduce partisanship, allow diversity of political parties and candidates, and empower voters. Would it work?","RCV means that instead of voting for one candidate, candidates are ranked -- who is the first choice, who is second, who third, etc. When votes are counted, a candidate receiving 50% or more of the votes immediately wins. If no candidate receives 50%, then the second choice of votes which supported the candidate with the fewest votes are given to the other candidates -- and so on for other candidates with lower vote totals until one candidate gets 50%. For example, in the 2004 presidential election in Florida, Bush received 2,912,790 votes, Gore 2,912,253 (a margin of 537 votes) and Ralph Nader received 97,488. If there had been RCV, the second choice of Nader voters would have been distributed between Bush and Gore. RCV advocates suggest that RCV allows a greater range of candidates and political parties while freeing voters from worrying whether they should vote for a candidate with a better chance of winning rather than a less popular candidate who they would really prefer. In addition, since candidates must compete for second-choice support from their opponents??supporters they will have less incentive to run negative campaigns. RCV is used in Alaska, Nebraska (for the state legislature) and in many U.S. cities. Would it be beneficial to use more widely?

PoliticalDiscussion,1gucz83,What validity does Kennedy have for removing water fluoridation?,"For starters, Flouride is added to our (USA, and some other countries) drinking water. This practice has been happening for roughly 75 years. It is widely regarded as a major health win. The benefit of fluoridated water is to prevent cavities. The HHS has a range on safe levels of Flouride 0.7 milligrams per liter. It is well documented that high level of Flouride consumption (far beyond the ranges set by the HHS) do cause negative health effects. To my knowledge, there is no study that shows adverse effects within normal ranges. The water companies I believe have the responsibility to maintain a normal level range of Flouride. But to summarize, it appears fluoridated water helps keeps its populations teeth cavity free, and does not pose a risk. However, Robert Kennedy claims that fluoridation has a plethora of negative effects. Including bone cancer, low intelligence, thyroid problems, arthritis, ect. I believe this study is where he got the ?œlow intelligence??claim from. It specifically states higher level of Flouride consumption and targets specifically the fetus of pregnant women. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9922476/ I believe kennedy found bone cancer as a link through a 1980 study on osteosarcoma, a very rare form of bone cancer. https://amp.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/chemicals/water-fluoridation-and-cancer-risk.html With all this said, if Flouride is removed from the water, a potential compromise is to use the money that was spent to regulate Flouride infrastructure and instead give Americans free toothpaste.

After all, he said on Wednesday, ?œpassing a tax bill that makes the president look good ??mailing out checks before the election ??means he could be reelected, and then we won?™t extend the 2017 tax cuts.??So. In order to MAYBE help the rich with keeping the 2017 tax cuts he wants to hold back support from poor people right now. **Example 2** Senate Republicans demanded that President Biden's national security funding package for Ukraine be tied to policy changes to address the crisis at the southwest border. But now that negotiators say they are ready to release details of a bipartisan plan to reduce the surge of migrants at the border, Republican divisions could scuttle the plan. > GOP Rep. Troy Nehls says backing a Senate border deal now would help Joe Biden's approval ratings. ""Why would we do anything right now to help him with that 33 percent?"" > But with an agreement in sight after four months of negotiations, many in the GOP now say that Congress doesn?™t need to pass new legislation and that Biden ought to simply take executive action to fix it. So. After years and months of wanting a border deal and calling for legislation, there is now a bipartisan deal negotiated in the Senate, which has GOP Senate leadership backing, they don?™t need it anymore because it might help Biden.

Kamala entered the race, her party energized, shifted the race. Does Trump's return reflect a desire to recapture the surge in support in the immediate aftermath of attack on him?","Former President Donald Trump is returning to Butler, Pennsylvania, where on July 13, 2024; a would-be assassin shot at him injuring his right ear, the shooter also critically injured two attendees \[a retired firefighter and a child\]. [ ](https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/2024/07/14/trump-rally-gofundme-victims-butler-shooting/74401694007/) Trump made the announcement on his Truth Social platform Friday \[7/26/24\] afternoon stating that he would return to Butler to pay respect to the two rally attendees who were killed by the shooter. After Trump's attempted assassination his popularity shot up as sympathy and well wishes poured in from all across the U.S. and abroad, his fund raising also soared. For a while, he appeared unbeatable as Democrats started losing hope of a Biden win. Shortly thereafter, Trump's then opponent, current President Biden withdrew and endorsed Kamala Harris. Within hours of Biden's announcement Kamala was on her way to set a record fund raising. Within 24 hours of her endorsement, she had broken the fund-raising record; a significant portion from new individual donors. An all-time record. By the end of 36 hours of her endorsement a sufficient number of delegates had committed to her to secure the future nomination and her combined funds had exceeded 200 million. The poll number began to shift as well. Trump no longer appeared invincible, and the race began to tighten. Sunday evening \[7/28/24\] the Fox News published a new survey comparing favorability ratings in swing states as follows: Kamala Harris -- Donald Trump Wisconsin 49% vs. 47% Pennsylvania 49% vs. 46% Minnesotan 51% vs. 43% Michigan 57% vs. 47% In the interim, the Harris Team is soon expected to announce its selection of the VP candidate and prepare for the Democratic National Convention in August.

Social Policies * **Healthcare**: Harris supports maintaining and expanding the Affordable Care Act to ensure that people with pre-existing conditions are not denied coverage. * **Reproductive Rights**: She strongly supports reproductive freedom and opposes Trump's extreme abortion bans.

Further disclosure, I used Video Summarizer by [thegeneralmind.com](http://thegeneralmind.com) to extract the closest thing to policy positions because its hard to know where Harris stands on certain things. It gets even more difficult to know because she flip-flops on issues. I believe in holding people accountable to their word no matter political affiliation. I also expect people seeking office to provide facts to support their positions. I feel like Kamala doesnt do well on this front. Our media largely fails at making this happen too, however, I've realized AI models can democratize fact checking and not only keep politicians honest but also ourselves. As an example, I've used AI to interrogate, summarize, and understand the border bill legislation because both sides are saying the bill does something different.

PoliticalDiscussion,1fhhuje,How will the Republican Party survive after Trump?,"The Republican Party in the US ever since Donald Trump has become president, and especially after he lost in 2020, has almost completely restructured to be centered around him and their support of him. There are exceptions of course but if Republican politicians want to survive electorally they have to be sycophantic in their support for Trump, lie for him, kiss his ring and even believe and justify everything he says a regardless of how untrue or otherwise disgusting it is. Even the RNC itself has a member of the trump family at it?™s head. Legislatures and congress pass or don?™t pass bills based off of what Trump demands, and it?™s very rare for republicans who do not like trump(be it politicians or even average people) to not become pariahs of the GOP or even family members. And my question is what will happen to the GOP once trump is gone? He?™s an old man and clearly in poor health. He will die of old age one day but because the GOP is centered around him and no one else who has tried to become his successor has succeeded or been anywhere near as successful(DeSantis, JD Vance, etc.) how will the GOP survive? Having studied cults and and cults of personality in particular for a long time, to me there are only three options: either the whole party essentially collapses and devolves into infighting, destroying itself in the process much like Millerites, the GOP undergoes a process akin to de-Stalinization such as what happened in the USSR under Khrushchev and moderates itself somewhat, or an insofar unnamed successor emerges from an internal power struggle and becomes the new charismatic leader of the party(IE: David Miscavage from Scientology or JF Rutherford of the Jehovah?™s Witnesses).

Claiming there are irregularities to be investigated, the Speaker of the House could maintain the current majority by refusing to swear in enough election winners to prevent the other party from gaining a majority and then refuse to certify the results of the presidential election.

PoliticalDiscussion,1g2xyqh,Before the 1990s Most Conservatives Were Pro-Choice. Why Did the Dramatic Change Occur? Was It the Embrace of Christianity?,"A few months ago, I asked on here a question about abortion and Pro-Life and their ties to Christianity. Many people posted saying that they were Atheist conservatives and being Pro-Life had nothing to do with religion. However, doing some research I noticed that historically most Conservatives were pro-choice. It seems to argument for being Pro-Choice was that Government had no right to tell a woman what she can and can't do with her body. This seems to be the small-government decision. Roe V. Wade itself was passed by a heavily Republican seem court headed by Republican Chief Justice Warren E. Burger as well as Justices Harry Blackmun, Potter Stewart and William Rehnquist. Not only that but Mr. Conservative himself Barry Goldwater was Pro-Choice. As were Gerald Ford, Richard Nixon, the Rockefellers, etc as were most Republican Congressmen, Senators and Governors in the 1950s, 60s, 70s and into the 80s. While not really Pro-Choice or Pro-Life himself to Ronald Reagan abortion was kind of a non-issue. He spent his administration with other issues. However, in the late 80s and 90s the Conservatives did a 180 and turned full circle into being pro-life. The rise of Newt Gingrich and Pat Buchanan and the Bush family, it seems the conservatives became pro-life and heavily so. Same with the conservative media through Fox News, Rush Limbaugh, etc. So why did this dramatic change occur?

Any analysis of the 2020 election shows that broadly speaking, especially in Swing States, the poor voted for Joe Biden and the wealthy voted for Trump, and that union members went for Joe Biden and non union members went for Trump. But that analysis also shows that Biden broadly won the educated people, people with college education and Trump won the votes of less educated people. Even looking at Jan 6, the people who stormed the Capitol weren't poor, they were wealthy.

PoliticalDiscussion,1bjbqa3,Why are Biden's approval ratings so low?,"It?™s surprising to note the range of opinions about him. It?™s common to hear varied views, from a lukewarm ?œhe?™s okay??to worse criticisms about his age and ability. His record, particularly given the circumstances he?™s faced, seems to contradict these views. While there were other potential candidates in 2020, his performance has been noteworthy imo. His age is a factor to consider for future terms, but let?™s focus on his achievements during his current term: * The American Rescue Plan has had significant impacts. It has made insurance more affordable for many families, allocated funds for affordable housing, public safety, and crime reduction. It has supported small businesses, expanded food and child care programs, invested in mental health centers, and provided assistance to families with children. It has also set aside $40 billion for American workers. Thanks to this plan, child poverty is now half of what it was. These areas have seen increased funding after years of underinvestment. * A $1 trillion infrastructure bill was passed to repair roads, waterways, bridges, and railroads, and to bring high-speed internet to rural areas. It includes funds for public transit and airports, electric vehicles and low emission public transportation, power infrastructure, and clean water. This aims to revamp the US infrastructure, a move not seen since the days of LBJ and FDR. * [The Inflation Reduction Act](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/themes/whitehouse/assets/img/record/inflation-reduction-act-50.png). * Employment is at an all-time high. 2021 and 2022 saw the strongest years of job growth in history. Nearly 11 million jobs have been created since he took office ??including 750,000 manufacturing jobs. The unemployment rate is at a 50-year low. The American economy is performing surprisingly well compared to other major economies, showing a strong rebound from the pandemic. A record number of small businesses have started since he took office. However, inflation remains a concern. * In terms of foreign policy: 1. He withdrew from Afghanistan. The execution had its challenges and the aftermath was complex, but many argue that the outcome was likely inevitable. This was a step that previous administrations had promised but never implemented. 2. He navigated a complex geopolitical conflict against a nuclear power that threatened the global order. This was the first time since World War II that a European state annexed the territory of another. At a time when allies were questioning their relationship with the US and when American influence seemed to be decreasing (France, Saudi, India, China, etc.), he managed to strengthen these alliances and coordinate a swift response against Russia, while providing support to Ukraine. * His ability to pass legislation is notable and is likely due to his extensive experience and the respect he commands from both sides of the aisle. This respect is built on decades of bipartisanship and close relationships. * Additional achievements include: climate change legislation, antitrust measures, the chips act, gun legislation, student debt relief, pardoning certain federal offenses, a diverse administration, increased health insurance coverage, and support for unions."" Given these achievements, why are his ratings so low?

Fast forward to now and -at least in my suburban/rural part of the world- it seems as if the tables are totally flipped; people who support Harris keep their political views more to themselves or their social media echospheres largely because they're afraid of the (possibly violent) response they may elicit. At the same time, pro-Trump & anti-liberal bumper stickers, yard signs, and flags pepper T-shirts, vehicles, and front yards. Is it different in large cities or other parts of the country?

PoliticalDiscussion,1glf4hu,How would the Trump administration be able to develop the logistics to deport the 10+ million undocumented migrants rumored to be in the US?,"Obviously after Trump winning last night, many people will have a lot of questions about future policy. One of his campaign promises is to start ""the largest deportation in history"" once he takes office. I have so many questions about how he will be able to do this. As of 2024, the US currently has 21,000 ICE officers employed throughout the country. How will a staff of this size be able to sweep the country for 10 million migrants? Will they need assistance from the military or national guard and how will they be able to train them to do this? Also, how will they be able to develop the infrastructure for detention of all these migrants? Will they be building camps or using existing prison infrastructure that is already at capacity? If Trump is able to get the manpower and resources to do this, it is very unlikely that Mexico and other Latin American countries will just willingly take these people back in. I can see this developing into a large scale humanitarian crisis. What is Trump's plan for this? Long term detention of migrants in camps? Granting them asylum or temporary visas? Dumping them across the border covertly? Forcing Mexico to accept them? If the migrants are all gone, who takes the place in society to do the jobs that they do? Does Trump believe that American citizens will be lining up to pick fruit in 100 degree weather for minimum wage? Who will clean hotels, work low level construction labor jobs, pick fruit, etc.?

Changing the taxation system to a residency-based one [has been expressed by both sides of the political spectrum over the years](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-double-taxation-tax-cuts-election-2024-1967142), and [studies have shown it to be tax revenue-neutral.](https://www.americansabroad.org/aca_deg_analysis_of_revenue_effects_of_residents_based_taxation) Now that Trump is president-elect, how can his administration realistically switch the US to a residency-based taxation system? Edit: How far should Trump go in making it making it easier for US citizens living abroad? Should he eliminate the [requirement for US citizens to report their foreign assets to the IRS every year (FBAR)?](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/report-of-foreign-bank-and-financial-accounts-fbar) Should he eliminate [FATCA, requiring foreign financial institutions to report US citizens and permanent residents to the US for taxation purposes?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Account_Tax_Compliance_Act) Ask any US person who's lived abroad and has tried to open a bank account. Most will tell you they've had some trouble or out right refusal by the bank due to FATCA. It *was* the Obama administration that pushed for and signed it into law... Edit 1: It's interesting to see the division in support-opposition in the comments are dependent on if you've lived abroad and have had to deal with filing FBAR and their tax return, dealing with FACTA, etc. It's a very common misconception that it's solely wealthy people and ""expats"" that makeup most US citizens living abroad. Especially since the US has unrestricted citizenship by birthright (via the 14th Amendment), there are hundreds of thousands of cases where children born of parents who've either immigrated or were here temporarily (vacation, work, study, etc) who've automatically obtained US citizenship. For the rest of their life, even if they never enter the US again, they have to deal with the hassle of filing yearly tax returns, filing FBAR, dealing with financial institutions refusing them due to not wanting to deal with FACTA, etc. And since they were born in the US, it will show on their other passport their place of birth, thus automatically showing they're a US citizen and can't ignore it. One example, a child is born to Mexican parents who've immigrated to the US and has both Mexican and US citizenship. A few years later, they return to Mexico and the child grows up there. Upon moving out of the home after graduation, they want to open a bank account. Many financial institutions will give him hassle or outright reject them due to FACTA requirements. But they're lucky and finds a bank that's willing to deal with the hassle of interacting with the IRS. A few years later, the person has been working. The IRS will demand why have they not only not filed a yearly US tax return, but especially why didn't they file the annual FBAR? After much more hassle and back and forth, the IRS is lenient and will have a minimal penalty since the person genuinely didn't know about the annual FBAR and tax return filing requirements. But next time they won't be so nice. Frustrated with the situation and why they have to pay the US taxes when they're not even in the country, the next year they decide to renounce their US citizenship, much to the dismay of their parents and family. They're stubborn and don't want to deal with this for the rest of their life, despite the opportunities the US would have for them, so they go to the US consulate and applies to renounce their US citizenship. However, the filing fee is $2,350 just to get the process started. On top of that, the IRS and Department of Treasury demand they pay one more set of taxes for the year up to date so there's no ""outstanding balance"", otherwise it won't be approved. You might think, this is such a niche example. But there are similar cases for hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dual citizens living outside the US. [In Mexico alone, in 2017 there were almost 900,000 Mexicans that were born in the US.](http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/data/estimates2/data/UN_MigrantStockByOriginAndDestination_2017.xlsx) It's one of those issues you don't think about much, if at all, and likely have some misconceptions until you experience it personally.

This raises significant questions about the role of the military in civilian matters and the legal framework surrounding such actions. Some context: * Previous discussions about using military resources for immigration enforcement, such as the deployment of troops to the southern border, were controversial and sparked debates about the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits military involvement in domestic law enforcement. * Critics argue that this plan could strain military resources and challenge constitutional norms. Supporters, however, view it as a decisive approach to address illegal immigration. **Questions for discussion:** 1. What legal and constitutional challenges might arise from using the military for deportations? 2. How might this policy impact the military?™s role in society and its public perception? 3.

PoliticalDiscussion,1fjueb8,"Who is the ""heir apparent"" for the 2028 Presidential Election in either party?","Let me preface this by saying that 2028 is obviously a super long time away, and by all intents and purposes we don't know who is going to win in 2024 as it appears to be one that'll come down to the wire. However, I think it's fun to speculate and then perhaps look back on later to see how predictions pan out. If Harris wins this election, then unless something extreme happens, she will run for reelection in 2028. However, should she lose, it appears that Democrats may face the most open primary cycle in a very long time. Obviously there were a few names speculated around the time that Biden dropped out, including but not limited to Gavin Newson, Gretchen Whitmer, Pete Buttigieg, or J.B. Pritzker. Do we think one of these potential candidates could keep momentum going long enough from right now to win a primary in 2028, or do we think that maybe a more up-and-coming player may emerge, perhaps someone younger like a Wes More? If Trump wins, he would also be term-limited. It would seem then, logically, that JD Vance would carry that mantle into 2028 (kind of how Harris is for Biden right now). Perhaps he would face an open primary, or maybe the party will rally around him as the heir apparent. I think the more interesting scenario, though, is if Trump loses. His hold on the Republican Party is well-documented at this point, although at age 82 and losing 2/3 presidential elections is pretty damning. Should he want to run yet again, would he even have the support to do so? or would voters reject him for someone new, and who could that possibly be?",TheRealWhiteChoco,2024/9/18 22:38,255,625,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1fjueb8/who_is_the_heir_apparent_for_the_2028/,https://reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1fjueb8/who_is_the_heir_apparent_for_the_2028/,,,,,,,

Can a former president be prosecuted for alleged crimes while in office [absent a prior impeachment, conviction and removal]?","Attorneys for former President Trump argued that he is immune from criminal prosecution for actions he took while in office \[official acts\]. The lawyers maintained, that had he been impeached and convicted while in office; he could have been subsequently prosecuted upon leaving office. \[He was impeached, but never convicted\]. They also argued that there is no precedent of prosecuting a former president for acts while in office as evidence that immunity attaches to all acts while in office. Trump also claims that the steps he took to block the certification of Joe Biden's election were part of his official duties and that he thus cannot be criminally prosecuted. Trump's attorneys wrote in their opening brief to the high court. ""The President cannot function, and the Presidency itself cannot retain its vital independence, if the President faces criminal prosecution for official acts once he leaves office..."" Earlier in February 2024, however, a unanimous panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected the former president's argument that he has ""absolute immunity"" from prosecution for acts performed while in office. ""Presidential immunity against federal indictment would mean that, as to the president, the Congress could not legislate, the executive could not prosecute and the judiciary could not review,"" the judges ruled. ""We cannot accept that the office of the presidency places its former occupants above the law for all time thereafter."" Jack Smith, the special counsel who indicted Trump on four counts related to his attempt to overturn his defeat by Joe Biden in 2020, argued: ?œPresidents are not above the law.??Earlier, the District court had similarly reasoned. Arguments by prosecution also noted that impeachment, conviction and removal is a political remedy distinguishing it from judicial accountability. And that the latter \[criminal prosecution\] is not dependent on what does or does not happen during impeachment. They noted as well illustrating a distinction between official and unofficial acts, giving an example that creating fraudulent electors for certification are not official acts... Constitutional law experts overwhelmingly side with Smith. Many reject the claim by Trump's that no president can be prosecuted unless he has been first been impeached, convicted and removed from office, they call that argument ""preposterous."" Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell had similarly rejected that idea when he voted against conviction in the second Trump impeachment.

PoliticalDiscussion,1f0ocue,Was there ever a reason given for why Robert F. Kennedy Jr. withdrew his presidential campaign as a democrat before the primaries?,"I ask this question in good faith and do not intend to attack anyone, because things are getting a bit muddled right now with him suspending his independent campaign making it difficult to search this topic online. I've admittedly not paid the most attention to RFK Jr. and am asking hoping for information. As we know, RFK Jr. initially ran in the Democratic Party for president and dropped out far before some of his opponents even began theirs. Was there ever a formal reason given for this? I understand that sometimes the answer is ""we don't know"", which I would prefer as an answer if true instead of speculating. RFK Jr.?™s supporters sometimes claim that he dropped out because of the Democratic Party sabotaging his efforts to run as a Democrat, which I find strange because him ?œwithdrawing??implies that he did it on his own. Of course, that could also mean he was compelled into doing so without a choice, but I find it strange that they would go after him specifically and not some of the other candidates. Even if something was going on behind the scenes that caused him to withdraw unwillingly, I don?™t see how that necessarily translates into corruption; I imagine that the DNC wouldn?™t want to support him if they sensed that he wasn?™t aligning with their values or for other reasons. I believe RFK Jr. himself claims that the DNC pushed him out, so I?™m also wondering if there?™s possibly precedent for them doing so (if true), whether or not it was legitimate. This topic is separate from the lawsuits against him to get on ballots ??I?™m getting mixed information on whether or not those lawsuits are fair or corrupt as well, but that?™s a different question (you can discuss that as well if you?™d like). I?™m just wondering if there?™s any justification to the claim that he was pushed out of the race before the primaries by the Democratic Party, whether it was out of corruption or reasonable issues. Or perhaps we don?™t know, because perhaps we don?™t know exactly what?™s going on in the party.

PoliticalDiscussion,1gyyiga,Trump won on a wave of dissatisfaction with the government and a desire for change. How can democrats restore that faith and what changes should they propose?,"There have been many conversations about why Harris lost. However, one of the most compelling ones I?™ve found is that Trump was an antiestablishment candidate who promised change against a system that is extremely unpopular. Democrats were left defending institutions that are unpopular and failed to convince the working class and the majority of Americans that they are on their side. Democrats never gave the American public the idea of what a new reformed government could look like under Harris. Trumps cabinet picks have primarily been focused on outsides and victims of the systems that they intend to run. It?™s clear that the appeal here is that Gabbard/RFK/Musk is going to clear out all the unpopular bureaucracy, inefficiencies and poor management of these institutions. For the most part, Americans are receptive of this message. Trump was elected by the plurality of the vote. Musk, RFK, and Rogan all have strong bases of support for being non conventional. Poll after poll voters have expressed extreme desire for significant change. After listening to Ezra Kleins latest podcast, they aren?™t exactly wrong. Americans don?™t trust democrats or the government in power. California and New York are the two most populous blue states that have the highest amount of people leaving. People see how projects like a speed rail has wasted billions of dollars and nothing to show for it after decades. They see how it cost $2 million dollars just to build a toilet. Despite these two states being economic and societal powerhouses, there?™s a reason that people are leaving that politicians are missing. But it?™s not just at the state level. Federal projects end up taking literally years due to the momentous amount of hoops and bureaucracy. Despite the CHIPS act being passed over 2 years ago, most of the money still hasn?™t been spent because of just how inefficient it?™s being handled. Simple things like investing in EVs end up being a confusing mixture of requirements bot h for consumers and companies that constantly moves on a yearly basis. I used to think that M4A struggled to gain momentum because of the cost but it?™s clear to me now that the hesitation that people have towards it is that they simply do not trust the government to run a system effectively or efficiently. Thats another reason why gun restrictions may be popular but rarely are motivating because people do not trust the government to enact that laws. I recall people talking about a government funded childcare and people are immediately worried about all the strings and bureaucracy that comes with it. It?™s a very common joke that anything the government does will be done poorly and take twice as long. Even when the child tax credit wasn?™t renewed because people didnt care enough.

PoliticalDiscussion,1c5w7lu,How will American courts find unbiased juries on Trump trials?,"The Sixth Amendment guarantees Trump ""the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed."" As Trump now faces criminal trial, how can this realistically be done within the United States of America? Having been president, he is presumably familiar to virtually all citizens, and his public profile has been extremely high and controversial in the last decade. Every potential juror likely has some kind of existing notion or view of him, or has heard of potentially prejudicial facts or events relating to him that do not pertain to the particular case. It is particularly hard to imagine New Yorkers - where today's trial is being held, and where he has been a fairly prominent part of the city's culture for decades - not being both familiar with and opinionated on Trump. To an extent he is a totally unique case in America, having been a celebrity for decades before being the country's head of state. Even Ronald Reagan didn't have his own TV show. So how would you determine whether the jury on one of Trump's trials is truly impartial or not? Can anyone who says they have no prior knowledge or opinion of Trump really be trusted about that? And how far does the law's expectation of neutrality go? Is knowing he was president prejudicial? It's a fact, and probably the most well-known fact about him, but even that could greatly influence one's partiality for or against him.",LorenzoApophis,2024/4/17 08:33,234,324,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1c5w7lu/how_will_american_courts_find_unbiased_juries_on/,https://reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1c5w7lu/how_will_american_courts_find_unbiased_juries_on/,,,,,,,

There are several indications that Harris should win and Trump won't outperform again: 1. As opposed to 2016, Harris has lots of enthusiasm on her side. Clinton didn't and Trump is hemorrhaging his. Harris has sold out rallies and Trump's are abandoned early. 2. As opposed to 2016, Harris is actually showing up in the states that matter. 3.

Just to be clear, I intend to ask this in good faith and maybe see something I'm not seeing. But I've been seeing around American politics, in particular to some Republicans and the rather contrary vision they seem to hold when it comes to certain military matters. Some Republicans for example seem to be rather adverse to Ukraine aid, on how it's just a big waste of money on part of American taxpayers or a concern that such aid might escalate into the US being dragged to a shooting war against Russia. However, a few of these same Republicans (DeSantis, Ramaswamy, Nikki Haley to name a few) are also the kind to take militaristic stances against the cartels in Mexico, where it's bound to cost some American troops to get killed in action and will probably cost the US a lot more of money. From what I see, the fight against the cartels through military means seem to be in-line with an 'America First' objective of fixing the fentanyl crisis that is said to claim the lives of over 100,000 Americans anually. So, why the adverse of aiding Ukraine due to escalation or financial concerns, but also are willing to support military action against the cartels in Mexico, where there's a potential of it being much more costlier and one that will definitely get American troops killed or potentially worsen the border crisis?",Excalibur933,2024/11/25 23:00,222,346,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1gzkrkg/why_do_some_republicans_are_so_hawkish_on/,https://reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1gzkrkg/why_do_some_republicans_are_so_hawkish_on/,,,,,,,

Note that cumulative inflation under Reagan was about the same. Details on that below. Now for the positives: The current US Misery Index is just a little higher than the modern low seen in September, 2015 and below the average in recent decades.

Over 13 million jobs have been added and more than 5 million above pre-pandemic levels. Moreover, economic conditions have generally exceeded expectations, so far [defying recession predictions](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/23/why-everyone-thinks-a-recession-is-coming-in-2023.html). In both presidencies, the situation significantly improved. Inflation by 1984 had dropped close to 4%. 3.2% now. But the prevailing narrative is that prices today are still elevated. If the argument is that people are still dealing with higher prices than 3 years ago (which is countered by rising incomes - real wages are above pre-pandemic levels), why didn't Reagan take the hit? Cumulative inflation during [his first 3 years was about 18%](https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl), similar to the last 3 years (19%). Both presidents inherited high inflation - Biden the global supply chain crisis that emerged in early 2021. Interest rates were far higher in 1984 too. Real wages were flat. Unemployment was still considerably higher, 7-8% in 1984. By objective measures, the economic situation today is significantly better than in 1984. I propose some reasons. What percentages would you assign to these? Feel free to add more. 1. Perceptions are far less influenced by objective reality and more influenced by a media sphere that delivers ""news"" that one wants to hear. Everyone has their own version that confirms one's confirmation biases. 2. Related to #1, Republicans in particular view the economy through very thick partisan lenses. Very likely, if we had a Republican president with the same economic situation, they'd be shouting it from the rooftops. Instead, the numbers are fake and they're bombarded with negative economic news spin. 3. Republican propaganda is effective. ""I did that"" stickers on the pump when global oil prices were high. Little positive when they dropped sharply. Media repeats the popular sentiment. 4. Some Democrats and Independents are less influenced by partisan spin and have a tendency to view the economy through other factors like inequality or having to work paycheck to paycheck. Thus, their views are usually negative. Combined with #2, results in solid net negative approvals for a Democratic president on the economy. 5. Mainstream press today in general tends to put a negative spin on economic news or highlights the negative aspects. i.e. news of job cuts vs hiring. Focus on cumulative inflation vs the big rate drops, wage increases, and very low unemployment. Consistent stories about the price of groceries now vs lack of similar narrative in 1984. 6. The timing of inflation leads to more people willing to give Reagan a break, as high inflation preceded his presidency while blaming Biden since it took off early 2021. This implies most of the public is unaware of the global supply chain crisis and the surge in global inflation in recent years. 7. Cumulative inflation still impacts people. Note I cover that above with Reagan. 8. The Reagan landslide vs current close race has much to do with current polarization. No one is likely to win by 18% or close to it these days. The polarization is particularly pronounced among Republicans.

PoliticalDiscussion,1e4wkru,"Teamsters President Sean O'Brien spoke at the Republican National Convention, delivering a staunchly anti-corporate, pro-union speech. Does this indicate a potential shift in the politics of organized labor?","On Monday, July 15, Sean O'Brien became the first Teamsters President to address the Republican National Convention. He did not endorse Donald Trump for President, though he praised his strength in relation to the recent assassination attempt. He also offered praise for specific Republican officials who in his view have supported unions (Josh Hawley in particular). At the same time, he called out anti-union politicians and groups within the Republican coalition, including the Chamber of Commerce, and he referred to corporate union busting as ""economic terrorism."" The Republican Party has historically been extremely hostile to unions, from opposing New Deal-era pro-worker policy to Reagan's breaking the air traffic controller strike to Republican-led state passing ""right to work"" laws. While union members are more likely to vote Republican than they used to be, unionized workers still lean Democratic and union leadership overwhelmingly supports Democratic candidates. What does Sean O'Brien's speech tell us about the present and future of unions in national politics in the U.S.? Does the Republican Party have the potential to transform itself into a pro-union populist party?

PoliticalDiscussion,1c7g49a,Why do third parties aim for the presidency in America?,"Even some pretty big parties in many other countries where third parties are fully legitimate don't try to run their own candidate at times. The LibDems in Britain don't really try to supply a prime minister. Others form an alliance to collectively propose a prime minister or president. American third parties have had success at other levels of government and have even had some decent runs in Congress during some periods. In the 55th Congress in 1897 to 1899, there were 12 third party senators out of 90, or 13.3%, and 27 representatives out of 343 or 7.8%, as just one example. They know how to form alliances, The Democratic-Populist-Free Silver ticket has been done before as have Liberal Republicans against Ulysses Grant. The Vermont Progressive Party has a decent sized caucus for a third party with 7 of 150 reps in the lower house in 2022 and has at least one senator and sometimes more than that, and only now that the base is there do they even try to run for governor and other statewide offices. And this is with a system that is just as subject to first past the post and ballot access issues as the US does in general. The third parties seem to get campaigns and donations, and then hit themselves with a hammer in a run for the presidency as opposed to doing something even remotely helpful by picking districts and races they could actually win. In the legislature they might be able to pull off actual deals, especially if the majority among the biggest party is small or even cause there to be no parties with an absolute majority of seats, which today, could actually realistically happen if they played their cards right.",Awesomeuser90,2024/4/19 06:06,211,304,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1c7g49a/why_do_third_parties_aim_for_the_presidency_in/,https://reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1c7g49a/why_do_third_parties_aim_for_the_presidency_in/,,,,,,,

The U.S. Supreme Court must rule by January 5, 2024, for Trump to be on the Co. Ballot. Is the Supreme Ct. very likely to overrule given the historical app., of the Clause?","The prior challenges on the same basis \[Section 3 of the 14th Amendment\] have been rejected in more than a dozen cases including the Minnesota Supreme Court. In some cases, Plaintiffs even withdrew the challenge. The clause at issue was designed to keep former Confederates from returning to government after the Civil War. It bars from office anyone who swore an oath to ?œsupport??the Constitution and then ?œengaged in insurrection or rebellion??against it and has been used only a handful of times since the decade after the Civil War. Chief Justice Brian D. Boatright dissented, arguing the constitutional questions were too complex to be solved in a state hearing. Justices Maria E. Berkenkotter and Carlos Samour also dissented. ?œOur government cannot deprive someone of the right to hold public office without due process of law,??Samour wrote in his dissent. ?œEven if we are convinced that a candidate committed horrible acts in the past ??dare I say, engaged in insurrection ??there must be procedural due process before we can declare that individual disqualified from holding public office.??The Trump campaign, which said it would swiftly appeal, described the ruling as ""a completely flawed decision."" Trump denies wrongdoing regarding January 6 and has decried the 14th Amendment lawsuits as an abuse of the legal process. The slim majority of the court found that Trump ""intended that his speech would result in the use of violence or lawless action on January 6 to prevent the peaceful transfer of power."" According to the court?™s ruling, despite Trump?™s ?œknowledge of the anger that he had instigated, his calls to arms, his awareness of the threats of violence that had been made leading up to January 6, and the obvious fact that many in the crowd were angry and armed, President Trump told his riled-up supporters to walk down to the Capitol and fight.??Trump then ?œstood back and let the fighting happen, despite having the ability and authority to stop it (with his words or by calling in the military), thereby confirming that this violence was what he intended,??the court found. ?œWhen President Trump told his supporters that they were ?˜allowed to go by very different rules??and that if they did not ?˜fight like hell,??they would not ?˜have a country anymore,??it was likely that his supporters would heed his encouragement and act violently,??the court found.

PoliticalDiscussion,1e9t98z,Would Kamala have had the same chances at the presidency had Biden not held on to his nomination for so long?,"One of the biggest worries that started popping up on Sunday was that the country isn?™t ready for a woman president yet. It makes sense, especially with Kamala as she didn?™t have the best reputation amongst Democrats to begin with coming out of the last election. That being said, in 24 hours she broke fundraising records and has near unanimous support across the party. Looking back at the political landscape at the start of the election season, I feel that she would have come in to the race with the same baggage as 2020. That includes the ?œcountry isn?™t ready??concern, and it would have been an uphill climb to overcome. Fast forward to today, the country had been reluctantly behind Biden. When he dropped out of the race, there was a palpable wave of energy that took the party by storm. People had hope, were inspired, and were excited at the possibilities of what comes next. Kamala entering the race right as this surge of enthusiasm picked up allowed people to look past the hypothetical concerns that plagued her before. Instead of wondering how America would react to a woman president, they were looking into why Democrats seemed to be so excited about her as a candidate. They went into their research with open eyes and a positive attitude, and came out as full blown supporters. That?™s the root of my question / discussion. We tend to look at Biden holding on to the nomination for as long as he did as damaging, as it left his replacement with only a few months to effectively campaign. But as we look back at that decision in years to come, will it ultimately be seen a good or a bad one?

Beyond the possible competing interests, Musk?™s potential foray into government would represent a striking development for the tech titan, who would essentially have a role at the highest levels of business, manufacturing, media and Washington. At the same time, handing Musk a position in his potential administration would fit neatly into Trump?™s approach to government.

PoliticalDiscussion,192x3bb,Why did Republicans such as Liz Cheney and Bill Barr turn against Trump after the 2020 election when they were staunch supporters beforehand?,"Since Trump became the de-facto Republican leader after the 2016 Presidential election, there had always been a significant number of anti-Trump Republicans who opposed him after he won the 2016 Republican nomination or not long after he became President. These include: Mitt Romney and John McCain etc. These opposed Trump due to his rhetoric, behaviour or policies. Romney voted to convict Trump after withholding aid to Ukraine, he was the only GOP senator to do this. John McCain voted against Trump?™s Obamacare repeal bill. There are also Republicans who turned on Trump after his attempts to overturn the 2020 US election but were loyal up to that point. These include Liz Cheney and Bill Barr. Cheney, who was the GOP House chair, strongly supported Trump publicly in his first impeachment on withholding aid to Ukraine. She called the impeachment ?˜a sham?? ?˜a political set up?? ?˜a waste of time??and ultimately voted against impeachment. She voted with Trump 93% of the time and supported his reelection in 2020, Romney did not. Likewise, Bill Barr was the Attorney General when the Muller report was released and concluded that it exonerated Trump, this is disputed. Furthermore, he appointed John Durham as a Special Counsel to investigate the Mueller investigation origins, this was just after 2020 election. Barr eventually resigned in December 2020 after concluding that there was no evidence of voter fraud.

PoliticalDiscussion,19a006h,Does the US media hold any culpability in Trump winning in 2016 and still being a political factor today?,"In 2016, it seemed like the only candidate on the news was Trump. And he was on the news *all the time*. Every outrageous, offensive or downright crazy thing he said was reported on obsessively. Even during the GOP primaries, the focus was on Trump in the media. During the general election, I remember reading a study (I wish I could find it) that on tv news, Trump got way more coverage than Hillary. From my recollection, it almost seemed like Trump was the only candidate running - or, at least, the only one the media cared about. Any other candidate who espoused similar rhetoric would never have left the sidelines. Jill Stein and RFK JR don?™t get coverage like Trump did, because they?™re crazy. I feel like the media inflated Trump from being a former 80s celebrity turned tv personality turned conspiracy theorist into a major political figure. Flash forward to now. Who do you hear about on the news? Trump. Whose trials and tribulations and insane comments still dominate the news? Trump. Consider that after Watergate, Richard Nixon spent over a decade in the political ?œwilderness??as a pariah, the one big exception being the Frost/Nixon interviews in 1977. It wasn?™t until the late 80s that news papers started talking about his rehabilitation. Yet, for as much as the media talks about J6, or Trump?™s other wrongdoings, they can?™t seem to stop giving him a platform, to stop talking about him. So my question to all of you is: Do you hold the media culpable in any way for Trump?™s first election and for him continuing to be a mainstream political figure?",Salem1690s,2024/1/19 04:32,202,306,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/19a006h/does_the_us_media_hold_any_culpability_in_trump/,https://reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/19a006h/does_the_us_media_hold_any_culpability_in_trump/,,,,,,,

PoliticalDiscussion,1flc9s4,Could Texas and Florida really be in play?,"I recently was checking out the status of the US presidential race since the debate and I see a major spike of momentum moving towards the democratic party winning the election. The sources used are realclearpolling, predictit and fivethirtyeight (538) election forecast. Harris/Waltz is no longer the honeymoon phase and current plus past momentum is moving in the same direction theoretically putting Texas and Florida in play. The numbers today on 538 show a 60-64% chance of Harris winning the election and Trump at 38% with the projected electoral college win being 300-238. That wasn't the part that really caught my eye. What caught my eye is when you scroll down to the state by state breakdown, they have Texas listed as 71-74% Trump to win and Florida as 65-68% chance to win. I can't get out of my head how improbable it seems as I think of Texas as a Republican stronghold, but the data is saying there is a chance. I realize that Texas always voted democratic for 150 years until Reagan ran for office, but that was before my time so I just think of them as a red state. My whole life Florida was always a swing state before Trump, so I could picture them moving to more of a swing state again but it seems almost impossible with Trump being a resident there. My question to the forum is this, are these numbers a mirage or are these two states really in play? This could be the peak of the Harris/Waltz campaign, but what if this momentum continues and it is an absolute landslide?

PoliticalDiscussion,18lnara,Should France pay reparations to Haiti?,"Nowadays, Haiti is largely known as a country deeply plagued by poverty and violence. They are also known to have been historically victimized by France. Haiti was a former slave colony of France. However, the slaves successfully revolted, and the colony claimed independence. France then demanded that they be compensated for their lost slaves. Facing military threats from France, new Haitian government agreed to this. In the decades that followed, France repeatedly threatened to invade, unless Haiti continued to make the payments. Haiti eventually paid off this debt. But, they faced significant economic hardship because of it. This debt played a large role in the country's impoverishment. In 2003, the Haitian government requested compensation from France. But, France categorically rejected this. Since then, the country has experienced significant problems, ranging from natural disasters, to disease outbreaks, to crippling gang violence. Meanwhile, their neighbor, the Dominican Republic, has flourished. It is noteworthy that the Dominican Republic was never forced to pay their former slave masters.

PoliticalDiscussion,1gmw1a4,What will be the impacts of Trump's tariff policy during his second term?,"Trump, who has long been supportive of using tariffs as a means of trade policy, has proposed among other things a[ flat tariff of around 10% on imports on other countries, as well as a 60% tariff on Chinese goods. In particular](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/08/politics/tariffs-donald-trump-strategy/index.html), Trump has stated that these tariffs will also provide revenue in order to offset the costs of what will likely be another massive round of tax cuts. Economists have warned that if these tariffs were to be implemented, it would cause a significant inflationary shock as company supply chains are disrupted and are forced to hike prices on certain goods in order to maintain profit margins. Given how Trump was elected off of a wave of anti-incumbent sentiment over inflation, a policy like this may end up eroding whatever goodwill and support he gained from voters hoping his presidency would resolve it. Not to mention the inevitable trade wars as countries impose tariffs of their own, hurting American manufacturers. Some have argued that Trump's proposed tariffs are merely a pre-negotiation ploy that can be negotiated down to more reasonable levels when trade talks with China, the EU and others resume. Others think that Trump will inevitably balk or be convinced not to overreach in order to avoid alienating voters with sudden sticker shock. But given how the moderating voices of Trump's first term are gone and Trump's own mercantilist views towards trade, its also just as possible Trump will proceed with his tariff plan as intended, perhaps hoping to deflect the backlash and claim it was the fault of certain countries and companies for not complying. In short, what do you suppose will be the economic and political of Trump's tariff policy will be?

The U.S. House had 194 Democrats, and 241 Republicans. Some argue the first Trump administration was very inefficient and despite the House/Senate majority, failed to get quite a few things done. I am not a political scholar, I don't have a list of these things. This year, the U.S. Senate has 47 Democrats, and 53 Republicans.

PoliticalDiscussion,1e031bq,Analysis of Biden vs Senate Candidates in Battleground States,"**Apologies if this analysis has been done before.** With all the discussion about whether Biden should drop out, and whether it would actually be advantageous for the Democrats if that happened, I decided to try to see how Biden might be performing relative to the generic battleground environment for Democrats. I did this by comparing the performance of Biden vs the Democratic Senate candidate in five battleground states (not every state has a Senate candidate in 2024). This approach has some advantages, such as controlling for the state-specific environments which are what actually decide the election. As we all know (hopefully) the popular vote does not decide the president, the electoral college does, so this kind of analysis in my opinion should be front of mind for the media (it never is). To do this, I looked at the most recent polls on 538 for both the Senate candidates and Presidential elections and added up the poll advantages for the senate candidate and Biden, then compared the averages of each. Most are June or later. [https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2024/nevada/](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2024/nevada/) [https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/nevada/](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/nevada/) The findings were pretty revealing, see below. In all cases Biden is trailing Trump, and is also underperforming the senator significantly. |State|Democratic Senate candidate|Senate Candidate advantage over opponent|Biden Advantage over Trump|Senate Candidates relative to Biden| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Pennsylvania|Casey|+5.8|-4.7|+10.5| |Arizona|Gallego|+4.0|-7.4|+11.4| |Wisconsin|Baldwin|+5.0|-1.6|+6.6| |Michigan|Slotkin|+2.5|-0.7|+3.2| |Nevada|Rosen|+8.2|-5.1|+13.3| |All|All|+5.1|-3.9|+9.0| The data suggests that in the battleground states the environment is quite favorable for Democrats with an approximately 5 point advantage. However, Biden is losing against Trump by an average of 3.9 points and is not leading in any state. This suggests that Biden may be performing approximately 9 points worse on average relative to the environment (ie what a generic candidate might be expected to do). **Devil's advocate:** 1. You could make the argument that voters in these states just like Trump more than the average Republican senate candidate. This argument doesn't make any sense to me given everything we know about Trump and the fact that Biden won all of these states in 2020. 2. A candidate that replaces Biden may not perform like a ""generic candidate"" given all the baggage that will come with the potential change happening at this point in the race. This is true, but given the delta I think the analysis can still help with understanding the potential impact of a change. **So, questions:** Should this kind of analysis guide Democratic decision making on whether or not to pressure Biden to drop out? Would a replacement for Biden be able to best his -9.0 performance relative to the Senate environment? Edit/Update: Can everyone please stop saying polls are useless or getting it wrong? The numbers presented here are averages, and pollsters all use different methodologies such that the aggregated polling is typically quite robust and accurate. Saying you don't believe the polls is a lazy argument and adds nothing to the discussion.",wherethetacosat,2024/7/11 02:26,175,298,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1e031bq/analysis_of_biden_vs_senate_candidates_in/,https://reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1e031bq/analysis_of_biden_vs_senate_candidates_in/,,,,,,,

PoliticalDiscussion,1ev2hiy,Implications of Donald Trump's Remarks at The Believers' Summit on the Future of Voting,"On July 26, 2024, former President Donald Trump delivered a speech at The Believers' Summit in West Palm Beach, Florida, where he addressed a predominantly Christian audience. During his speech, Trump made several notable statements, including, ""Christians, get out and vote, just this time. You won't have to do it anymore. Four more years, you know what, it'll be fixed, it'll be fine. You won't have to vote anymore, my beautiful Christians. I love you, Christians. I'm a Christian, I love you. Get out, you got to get out and vote. In four years, you won't have to vote again. We'll have it fixed so good, you won't have to vote."" These comments have sparked a range of interpretations and concerns. Some argue that Trump's statements were hyperbolic, meant to energize his base with promises of a return to ""normalcy"" or stability under his leadership. Others worry that his words could be interpreted as undermining the democratic process, particularly the importance of voting as a civic duty. Given the significance of these remarks, what do you think Trump meant by saying, ""In four years, you won't have to vote again""? Could this be a rhetorical flourish, or does it suggest a more profound perspective on governance and democracy? How might such statements influence voter behavior, particularly among his Christian supporters? Could they lead to increased voter turnout, or might they have the opposite effect? What are the broader implications for democratic norms if a significant political figure suggests that voting may no longer be necessary in the future? How does this align with or contradict traditional American values regarding the electoral process?

In 2000 and 2004, Bush carried it by 8%. Obama carried it by 6% and 4%. Clinton carried it by 5%, Biden carried it by 10%, and Harris carried it by 5%. Notably, the number of voters who voted for Trump increased in the last two elections.

PoliticalDiscussion,1d5mf7u,Why didn't Ron DeSantis do better in the Republican primary?,"People just reflexively say something like ""Republicans love Trump"" but I think this just sort of begs the question. The answer to this question has serious implications for what the future of the party looks like. DeSantis essentially packaged himself from the beginning of the campaign as ""Trump without the baggage"" which in theory seems pretty good from a Republican voter's perspective--you get everything you want if DeSantis gets elected without the risk of criminal convictions or other weird Trump stuff that could derail his campaign (not to mention the health risk of nominating someone that old). Yet, Republicans not only rejected DeSantis, but did so fairly decisively. There are some possible explanations for DeSantis' poor performance including: * **DeSantis is a bad campaigner**. Some in the media have suggested he has an awkward persona that doesn't connect well with voters. Perhaps a candidate with DeSantis' platform and background but with a different personality would have been more successful. * **Trump's policy platform is actually different from DeSantis in ways that mattered.** In some ways, Trump is a little more moderate than DeSantis, particularly on social security/Medicare and abortion. The former was an issue that Trump actually highlighted during the campaign in criticizing DeSantis. Maybe Republican voters are closer to Trump's stance on these issues than DeSantis and chose Trump for that reason. * **Republican voters** ***like*** **the ""baggage.""** While to outsiders the criminal and personality stuff with Trump seems like a negative, Republican voters may have considered it a positive in that it shows he's different and fighting the system. DeSantis reads as more of a ""normal politician"" and therefore can't compete with Trump in that area. What do you think? Is it one of these? Some combination? Or something different?

PoliticalDiscussion,1fcxd37,Why are Senate Dem candidates running ahead of Kamala Harris in the rust belt?,"As usual, the rust belt states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin are all competitive in this election. The latest 538 averages have Harris up but a very close race in each state with Harris up just under 1 point in PA and only a point or two better in MI and WI. This isn't surprising, but what's interesting is that all three of those states have senate races, and in all three the Democratic candidate is doing *significantly* better than Harris. 538 doesn't create averages for those races, but a quick look at recent polls that they compile shows that the Democratic candidate has a lead in about the high single digits in most recent polls (PA is a little tighter with an average probably around 5, but still considerably better than Harris' 0.7% lead). What explains this discrepancy? All three Democrats who are running in these races are fairly ""mainstream"" Democrats whose positions on most issues are nearly identical to Harris so this isn't a case of the candidates simply being a better fit for their states (like it's less surprising that Sherrod Brown and Jon Tester are doing better than Harris in their states). You'd think if you were a voter who agreed with Bob Casey or Elissa Slotkin, you'd probably be voting for Harris too, but for whatever reason that doesn't seem to be the case. It could be that voters simply like these candidates better than Harris, but another intriguing possibility is that it has nothing to do with the Dem candidates vs. Harris, but rather it has to do with *Trump* being a stronger candidate than the Republican candidates in these races. In all three races, the Republicans nominated fairly conventional candidates (no repeat of the Mehmet Oz situation), yet they are all running behind Trump. Could it be that the Republican policy platform is simply not popular in these states and that they have only seemed competitive in this era because Trump is personally popular there? This hypothesis finds some support in that Republicans have lost every senate and gubernatorial race in all three states from 2016 through 2022 except for two (Pat Toomey and Ron Jonson's very narrow wins in 2016 and 2022, respectively).

PoliticalDiscussion,1c099h1,What will be the impact of Republicans attempting to use certification deadlines to remove Biden from office?,"Republicans in Ohio and Alabama are attempting to use certification deadlines to remove Biden from the general ballot, arguing that because the Democratic convention will occur after their self-imposed deadline Biden will not be eligible for the Presidential ballot in their state. In Alabama, the deadline has been Aug 15 since 1975. The RNC Convention has been held after that point in 2004 (Aug 30), 2008 (Sept 1), 2012 (Aug 27), and 2020 (Aug 27), but it was never an issue that removed a President from the ballot. Likewise, the DNC convention has been held after this arbitrary deadline in 5 of the last 6 elections. In Ohio, a similar incident happened in 2016. In that incident, both campaigns had conventions scheduled outside the deadline window, so Ohio lawmakers approved changing the cutoff to 60 days, but only for that election. This time, the Secretary of State's office informed Ohio Democratic Party Chairwoman Liz Walters about the issue, telling them to change the law or risk Biden not appearing on the ballot. Republicans have a 65-34 advantage in the Ohio House and a 25-8 advantage in the Ohio Senate. What will the final fallout be? Are these merely procedural issues that will be glossed over, as they have been in the past, or are these retaliatory strikes for attempts to remove Trump from the ballot? Does the failure to honor the laws in the past render them moot going forward, or would they be upheld in the court? And what would the affect be on down-ballot elections and the general election if they succeed with this push? A similar thing could happen in other states. In a brief perusal shows Alaska has a deadline of the 20th, and the DNC runs Aug 19-22.

PoliticalDiscussion,1bbp444,Another Federal legislative attempt at banning Tik Tok is afoot in the U.S. and proceeding rapidly. Prior attempts have failed. Government claims it has addressed the First Amendment concerns. Is the anticipated new ban likely to survive court challenges?,"The underlying motivation to ban Tik Tok app in the U.S. as expressed by the U.S. government is its national security concerns. Although TikTok doesn?™t operate in China the concern is that the Chinese government enjoys significant leverage over Tik Tok; the theory goes that ByteDance \[the parent company\], and thus indirectly, TikTok, could be forced to cooperate with a broad range of security activities, including possibly the transfer of TikTok data. U.S. government plans to force ByteDance to divest any interest in Tik Tok app \[sell\] it to a U.S. based company \[such as Microsoft\] if it wants to continue to do business in the U.S. ?œIt?™s not that we know TikTok has done something, it?™s that distrust of China and awareness of Chinese espionage has increased,??said James Lewis, an information security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ?œThe context for TikTok is much worse as trust in China vanishes.??The US government has said it?™s worried China could use its national security laws to access the significant amount of personal information that TikTok, like most social media applications, collects from its US users. To date, there is no public evidence that Beijing has actually harvested TikTok?™s commercial data for intelligence or other purposes. Chew, the TikTok CEO, has publicly said that the Chinese government has never asked TikTok for its data, and that the company would refuse any such request. TikTok has about 170 million users in the United States. 60% are female, 40% are male. 60% are between the ages of 16-24. Tik Tok has encouraged its users to influence the legislators from enacting into legislation banning the app download. Furthermore, Tik Tok intends to challenge any forthcoming legislation in courts as a violation of its users First Amendment Rights. Previously Trump also tried banning Tik Tok, but now he has changed his position stating: ?œIf you get rid of TikTok, Facebook and Zuckerschmuck will double their business.????..I don?™t want Facebook, who cheated in the last Election, doing better. They are a true Enemy of the People!??The measure that sailed unanimously through the House Energy and Commerce Committee would prohibit TikTok from U.S. app stores unless the social media platform ??used by roughly 170 million Americans ??is quickly spun off from its China-linked parent company, ByteDance. If enacted, the bill would give ByteDance 165 days, or a little more than five months, to sell TikTok. If not divested by that date, it would be illegal for app store operators such as Apple and Google to make it available for download.

PoliticalDiscussion,1ayon4k,Why does anyone believe Trump's election claims given their complete failure in court?,"Could it be that the dismissal of all 62 election fraud cases brought forth by Trump and his allies in courts across the US strongly signifies the lack of credible evidence supporting his claims? Despite assertions of widespread fraud, courts consistently dismissed or dropped them due to a lack of evidence or standing. Furthermore, the contrast between public claims and courtroom actions raises doubts about the sincerity of the allegations. Events, such as Dominion Voting Systems winning a $788 million settlement against Fox News for promoting baseless conspiracy theories (and prominent hosts and top executives were aware the network was reporting false statements), and admissions of misrepresentation by Trump's lawyers, further discredit these claims. In Pennsylvania, Rudy Giuliani initially alleged widespread fraud but later backtracked, stating ""This is not a fraud case."" In the same case, Trump lawyer Linda Kearns admitted to not proceeding on allegations of fraud. Given the legal consensus, disconnect between public rhetoric and legal action, and admissions of misrepresentation, should we lend credence to these allegations, or view them as politically motivated attempts to undermine the electoral system?",VeryHungryDogarpilar,2024/2/24 15:23,146,177,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1ayon4k/why_does_anyone_believe_trumps_election_claims/,https://reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1ayon4k/why_does_anyone_believe_trumps_election_claims/,,,,,,,

PoliticalDiscussion,1evhpo8,How should the United States deal with authoritarian allies violating the human rights of their own citizens?,"While the US has maintained a close alliance and strategic partnership with multiple authoritarian countries for decades almost all of them being in the Middle East, its ties with one authoritarian country has been upgraded relatively recently. Almost 50 years since the end of the Vietnam War and 25 years since the normalization of bilateral diplomatic relation, the United States has elevated the relations with Vietnam to the highest levels than ever before with the Biden administration formally declaring a ""Comprehensive Strategic Partnership"" during the state visit to Hanoi in September of last year. This means deepening of defense and economic ties with the US providing hundreds of million of dollars in security assistance and American companies ramping up investment in Vietnam?™s tech and manufacturing sectors. This has clearly been driven by mutual concerns over China's aggressive behavior and assertiveness in the South China Sea and other countries in Southeast Asia namely Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, and possibly even Malaysia and Thailand gravitating even further towards China's sphere of influence. Vietnam also has the potential to contribute to the US's efforts of supply-chain diversification as an alternative low-cost manufacturing hub. However, in the midst of this significant expansion of ties and cooperation, the one-party authoritarian government of Vietnam has also been growing much more hostile to threats to its grip on the country in a reversal of the political liberalization of the 2000s. In the last couple years, it has been carrying out its most intense political crackdown in decades, jailing scores of labor and environmental activists, lawyers and journalists and driving even more into exile. The ascension of TÃ´ LÃ¢m, the security chief who has presided over the crackdown, to the position of General Secretary of the Communist Party earlier this month indicated that the political repression could grow even worse. Even so, the US government has been reluctant to push back on this issue and has not conditioned new agreements on improvement of human rights. The US has also been ignoring Vietnam's purchase of Russian arms exports even as American sanctions on multiple foreign geopolitical adversaries expand to higher than ever. **How should the United States deal with autocrats and authoritarian or nondemocratic countries that are also important strategic allies for security and economic interests?** **How much should democracy and human rights factor into the need to court authoritarian countries to counter China and Russia or pursue regional peace and stability in war-torn regions such as the Middle East and the Sahel?**",GalahadDrei,2024/8/19 03:32,137,135,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1evhpo8/how_should_the_united_states_deal_with/,https://reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1evhpo8/how_should_the_united_states_deal_with/,,,,,,,

(Understanding MAGA),"As a European observer, I am intrigued by the slogan ?œMake America Great Again??and am keen to hear from Americans about which decade they feel is being referenced when they hear these words. It is often noted in discussions about foreign policy that members of MAGA or the Republican party assert that the country needs to ?œfix itself first.??However, a follow-up question is rarely posed, or the conversation is often redirected at this point. My inquiry is based on the premise that the slogan ?œMake America Great Again??implies a reference to a specific period when America was perceived to be great in the hearts of the people and suggests that something is currently amiss. This notion of greatness is, of course, highly subjective and can vary significantly depending on one?™s demographic and generational perspective. Which era do you believe encapsulates this greatness, and what specific aspects of that time contribute to this perception? Additionally, how do these aspects compare to the present day, and what changes do you think are necessary to restore or even surpass that greatness? The ?œMake America Great Again??slogan is undoubtedly powerful, as it resonates deeply on an emotional level. However, for a European understanding the underlying sentiments and historical references can provide a more nuanced perspective on what this slogan truly represents for different individuals. Also, the US socioeconomic indicators are generally positive despite decade-long ongoing challenges, while increased living costs seem to be a global problem.

What does it mean for the anti-abortion movement?","Link to major new article discussing it: * https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/abortions-rose-roe-overturned-why-rcna181094 A big point here is that in 2021, the FDA eliminated the requirement to dispense Mifepristone (the abortion pill) in person. This has helped groups of medical providers find ways to prescribe and ship abortion pills around the country from places where they?™re still legal. Shield laws, enacted in some of the most pro-choice states in America following Roe's overturn which guarantee providers immunity for prescribing pills to patients in states where abortion is now banned, have also been helpful here. Another dynamic at play is that abortion is now protected in 32 states by new laws, courts ruling that access is protected by their state's constitution and citizen-initiated Constitutional Amendments & ballot referendums where they haven't (although not every state allows this). Another two states protect abortion through the First Trimester, by when 90% of all abortions occur. And a lot of these laws and new Constitutional Amendments in particular are going farther in their protections than existed in the final years of Roe, plugging a lot of the coverage and access gaps that Republicans had managed to exploit particularly when it came to women of color and people of low incomes. Overall, these factors meant that in 2023, a year after Roe v. Wade was overturned, over 1,000,000 abortions took place nationwide, the highest total in a decade. What are your thoughts on this? And what does it say about the anti-abortion movement? The pro-life side fought for 50 years to overturn Roe, they fought for generations to concentrate power in the hands of the states specifically, hoping to ban it in half the country they controlled and drastically reduce the amount of abortions (to start with). However, overturning Roe did not reduce abortions on its own, and in various traditionally Republican states from Montana to Kansas to Missouri to Ohio to Arizona, they've watched voters go on their own and codify access to a level stronger than Roe into their state constitutions. In other conservative states like Alaska, Utah, Wyoming and North Dakota, they've lost in courts that said their constitutions protect it too. And they've pretty much exhausted other states where they could try to ban it, while the pro-choice side still has several left where they could bring ballot measures to override existing bans. Attacking abortion has also become a big political loser, with Donald Trump forced to go out of his way to say he'd veto national restrictions and leave it at the hands of these courts and ballot measures at the state level. And previously viewed ""common ground"" and ""compromise"" 15-week bans for example have lost decisively in competitive states like Arizona and Virginia over the past year. Considering that virtually every developed country has already defeated their conservatives trying to ban abortion, does the anti-abortion wing still have a path to victory or major restrictions in the US?",Spiderwig144,2024/11/29 00:20,179,145,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1h1zj6l/abortions_in_the_us_have_increased_since_roe_v/,https://reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1h1zj6l/abortions_in_the_us_have_increased_since_roe_v/,,,,,,,
PoliticalDiscussion,1btxtbg,"Has the 'Starve the beast' strategy ever been effective in reducing government spending and promoting fiscal responsibility? Or could it be motivated by partisan political objectives, like deliberately undermining trust in government institutions?","""Starve the beast"" is a strategy commonly attributed to the Republican Party in the United States, aiming to reduce government spending by cutting taxes, thereby decreasing government revenue. Theoretically, this reduction in income would force the government to curtail its spending, leading to a smaller and more efficient government. However, has this strategy ever been effective in achieving its stated goals? Critics argue that, rather than reducing government spending, ""Starve the beast"" has consistently led to increased budget deficits and national debt. This is because cutting taxes without corresponding spending reductions does not actually decrease the government's financial obligations. Instead, it reduces the revenue available to meet those obligations, leading to borrowing and an accumulation of debt. Furthermore, the strategy can have adverse effects on essential public services and social programs, as reduced revenue can force cuts in areas like healthcare, education, and infrastructure. Are there any examples where cutting taxes could be argued to have improved government efficiency? Are there instances in history where this strategy has worked as intended? What might be the broader implications of the ""Starve the beast"" strategy on political discourse and governance? Does it have an impact on partisanship and public trust in government institutions? Has the ""Starve the beast"" strategy ever been employed by the Democratic Party? For example, the Clinton administration's efforts to balance the budget in the 90s included spending cuts, but also involved tax increases. How does this compare to the typical ""Starve the beast"" approach? How have fiscal conservatives responded to data from organizations like the Congressional Budget Office and the Economic Policy Institute, which suggest that the ""Starve the beast"" strategy has not achieved its stated goal of reducing government spending? What lessons can be learned from the experiences with the ""Starve the beast"" strategy, and are there alternative strategies that could be more effective in achieving fiscal responsibility and sustainable government spending? Additionally, how do concerns about the national debt factor into discussions about the ""Starve the beast"" strategy? Considering that the national debt is often held by domestic and international investors, including companies and other governments, how does this complexity impact our understanding of government finances and the implications of tax cuts?",Deleted,2024/4/2 20:44,133,193,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1btxtbg/has_the_starve_the_beast_strategy_ever_been/,https://reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1btxtbg/has_the_starve_the_beast_strategy_ever_been/,,,,,,,

Notwithstanding a change in political tides or health, he is set to lead Senate Democrats for many years to come. Leadership succession for Senate Democrats has been fairly routine since LBJ redefined the position's power in the 1950s; the sitting Whip would succeed the Leader. However, Dick Durbin, the Democratic whip since 2005, will turn 80 this year. He has, however, filed to run for re-election in 2026. Whether or not Schumer stays as Democratic leader for the next decade, or if he steps down before then - say, to become [president pro tempore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_pro_tempore_of_the_United_States_Senate) if everyone above him in seniority retires - who are the likely contenders to replace him? This question has been asked before on Reddit, on subreddits like r/neoliberal, but only mentioning senators who are in the news often or former presidential candidates. Here are some qualifications I had in mind; they may seem obvious but I believe they merit description: * Individuals with a proven record of success and loyal service to the Senate Democratic leadership. Fundraising is key here. * Individuals who are able to articulate the viewpoints of all factions of Senate Democrats without being pigeonholed into any specific faction. A talented messenger. * Individuals without significant controversy. No one inside or outside the Senate would be outraged beyond normal ""politics"" at their selection. * Individuals already in the leadership. Deputy whips, caucus vice chairs, caucus secretary, etc. * Individuals who don't upset the regional balance in the leadership. To throw my answer into the ring, [Chris Van Hollen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Van_Hollen) (D-MD) comes to mind. Without being too detailed, his entry in the latest *Almanac of American Politics* made a deep impression. I'd also mention Gary Peters, Brian Schatz and Amy Klobuchar as up-and-comers currently in the leadership who are young enough by Senate standards. 1. While in the House, Van Hollen was the [House Dems' lead elections coordinator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Congressional_Campaign_Committee) from 2007 to 2011 (the [2008 elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections): 21-seat gain for Dems) and a trusted lieutenant of Nancy Pelosi. 2. Van Hollen's campaign experience in the House resulted in his selection as the [DSCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Senatorial_Campaign_Committee) chair (campaign recruitment and funding for the Senate Democrats) six weeks before even joining the Senate. It mirrors how Schumer came into Harry Reid's trust through his outstanding work at the DSCC in the 2006 and 2008 Senate elections. 3. Van Hollen was also cited in the Almanac for talent as both a politician and policy wonk. I also haven't seen any prominent disputes between Van Hollen and Schumer. The only real drawback is that aside from being DSCC chair from 2017 to 2019, Van Hollen is no longer in the Senate leadership.

Edit: attempt to fix formatting: * Incumbency advantage of Senate candidates * could partly explain Casey / Baldwin / Brown * although incumbency advantage not as strong as it once wasThe persistent negative media tone and content regarding the Biden/Harris presidency that pushed their approval ratings down - the big gap between objective views of the economy and public views. -inflation blame for example that doesn't drip down to Senators * Democratic-leaning voters want to see more from Harris before committing or switching. -Split ticket voters under impression (real or not) that Harris is to much to the left -doesn't explain why Biden's standing was worse * Identity politics (somewhat related to #3) * -counter: Biden had his own age-related issues * certainly could be due to large white population in places like PA and WI * Same counterpoints with Biden * Unique centrist cred of some Senate candidates * Might explain some of Casey's appeal and larger gap, but not as obvious with the others * The general negative media narrative that has burdened the Biden/Harris presidency What might Harris and her party do to close the gap and bring home Democratic voters? Others? * Be especially proactive with getting Senate candidates and other key popular players like Shapiro to be good surrogates, emphasizing that there's not much risk in their strong advantage eroding (Brown's probably an exception in a red-leaning state). * Go with more progressive ideas to bring out base. examples? * Risk is media saying they are ""tone deaf"" to views of ""real Americans who are suffering"". * Emphasize recent improvements, such as the inflation rate falling under 3%. * Emphasize new policies to help Americans with costs rather than fighting the bad narratives too much. * See recent set of policy proposals * Emphasize forward-looking policies that have long-term benefits, such as IRA * Specific focus during this week's Democratic Convention content? Polling data description: I'm including the 538 aggregate for the presidential polls in states that have done a lot of polling since late July. Since there isn't one for the Senate races, I'm averaging the polls going back to late July. It's based on a quick manual estimate so the results are probably not too precise, but mostly expecting it to be within +- 1, close enough for this analysis. I didn't include other states like OH or NV since there are only 2-3 recent polls, but the theme is the same. Harris underperforms Senate candidates by 4-5 points on average.

PoliticalDiscussion,1cuds2v,Will the Fox-Dominion settlement deter similar misinformation about the 2024 election?,"As you may know, in 2023 Fox News settled a defamation lawsuit from Dominion Voting Systems for 787.5 million dollars regarding false claims that Dominion had rigged the election against Trump. This being the largest settlement for a media defamation case in US history, do you think it will be enough to dissuade commentators from making similar false allegations in the coming election? Notably, other conservative sources such as Newsmax and OAN also made claims about Dominion and were also sued. Though Newsmax issue a retraction and apology, their defamation trial begins in September. OAN reached a settlement with Dominion in 2023 as well. Likewise, Rudy Giuliani, who was already involved in the Fox-Dominion suit, declared bankruptcy in December 2023 after paying $148 million for defaming two election workers. Given that Trump and his allies continue to claim he won the election, will conservative media make similar allegations again? Will the legal consequences be sufficient to deter misinformation about the election in general, only outright defamation, or neither?

PoliticalDiscussion,1eaf3tf,Is the Free Palestine movement running out of steam?,"With the nomination of Kamala Harris looming, it seems like Biden stepping down as energized voters who were otherwise on the fence about participating in the election. There is a lot of infighting in the left right now regarding the DNC?™s stance on Palestine and Gaza. Critics of Joe Biden lament that he did not come down on Israel harder, and claim that a Harris presidency won?™t yield better results for Gaza. However, there has been a bit of a backlash against the backlash so to speak. Many liberal voters seem to be disengaging from the Palestinian conflict to focus on domestic issues, such as securing abortion and LGBT rights. Frustration against pro-Palestinian voters seems to be a bit more common as they fail to find a compromise. Does this spell the end of the massive Free Palestine movement on the left? For almost a year now, this movement has dominated the space, with massive student protests and public demonstrations. But with the election on the horizon, are we seeing a divestment from overseas issues? Where do you see the free Palestine movement shifting towards in the future?

PoliticalDiscussion,1azpmlf,Who left the Republican coalition in the 1990s?,"Beginning with the 1968 election, Republicans won 5 out of 6 presidential elections over the 20 year period through the 1988 election and they generally did so by commanding margins.

By comparison, no candidate in the last 32 years has achieved either of these feats. These numbers are even more impressive when you consider that the only election they lost--1976--was heavily influenced by Watergate (and it was still relatively close). The two 90s elections are difficult to read much into because of the presence of a strong third party candidate, but in the elections since then, the pattern has been clearly different--every election has been very close with, if anything, Democrats having a slight advantage.

My concern is not about Trump's desires specifically, but how if non-military federal employees became at-will workers, how such a change would work and impact how the federal government carries out its tasks, both routine and long-term. Would the threat of being fired or benefit of being hired alter how government workers do their jobs compared to the private sector?

PoliticalDiscussion,1bydheq,"How many of those voting Uncommitted in the Democratic primaries due to Gaza will actually remain Uncommitted in November, regardless of whether the war is still ongoing?","The pro-Palestinian bloc of the Democrats coalition have essentially been trying pressure Biden to pivot on Israel/Palestine through voting uncommitted/uninstructed/etc during the primaries. The message trying to be sent is that if he doesn't at least end military and political support for Israel's campaign, they will seriously consider abstain from voting for Biden in the general election. And with it likely to be another close race dependent on turnout, disgruntled Dems particularly from the 18-34 demographic that are strongly pro-Palestine as well as voters in swing states like the Muslim community in Michigan sitting out could very well determine the outcome. The question though, is whether or not the voters openly threatening to abstain if Biden doesn't pivot on I/P will actually commit to abstaining in November. On the one hand, the fear of a second Trump presidency and all that entails is likely to have a powerful effect on getting the Dems to close ranks and cause even those discontent over Biden's support for Israel to hold the nose and ""vote for the lesser evil"". After all its one thing to protest vote during an uncontested primary, it's another to do so in November when you have to seriously consider the consequences of what may happen if the other party wins. On the other hand, some point to the discontent among grassroots Dems over the war in Gaza as signs the Dems could be in the same precarious position as in 2016 where a lack of enthusiasm and support for the ""establishment"" candidate resulted in lower turnout from the Dems, allowing Trump to notch an Electoral college win.

PoliticalDiscussion,199pwkv,"In El Salvador, women who get abortions or suffered miscarriage are prosecuted and sent to jail. Will these policies eventually be adopted by states controlled by Republicans?","So, a quick brief background: El Salvador's 1956 Penal Code contained no explicit exception to its prohibition of abortion, although, under accepted principles of criminal law, one could be justified if necessary to preserve the life of the pregnant woman. In 1973, a new penal code was passed which stated that an abortion could be legally allowed under three major conditions: if the pregnant woman's life was endangered and abortion was the only means to preserve it, if her pregnancy had resulted from rape or statutory rape, or if a serious congenital disorder was detected in the fetus. Furthermore, an abortion caused on part of the woman's negligence was exempted from prosecution, and the government also provided reduced penalties for a woman of good standing if she had consented to an illegal abortion, or self-induced one, in the interest of protecting her reputation. However, in the 1990s, an alliance between the Catholic Church and Evangelical politicians began to draft a new bill which would amend the penal code to ban all exceptions which would make abortions illegal under any circumstances. In 1998, this new bill passed the country's Legislative Assembly. Under this Code, a person who performs an abortion with the woman's consent, or a woman who self-induces or consents to someone else inducing her abortion, can be imprisoned for two to eight years. A person who performs an abortion to which the woman has not consented can be sentenced to four to ten years in jail; if the person is a physician, pharmacist, or other health care worker, he or she is instead subject to between six and twelve years. Furthermore, the country amended its Constitution in January 1999 to recognize human life from the moment of conception. https://apnews.com/article/abortion-health-san-salvador-caribbean-sexual-abuse-by-clergy-9abc96c63c374bf68921c9c584e7ce84 https://apnews.com/article/abortion-politics-health-caribbean-religion-8dcebe19ea1d3f20ef288463f4392da4 If you look at the above two articles, you will see the consequences of what happened to women who get an abortion or suffer a miscarriage. Basically, for the Pro-life/Anti-Abortion advocates, Abortion should be seen as murder since it is the killing of an unborn child. Therefore, in El Salvador, the politicians who enacted these abortions bans believe that since Abortion is the killing of an innocent life, any women who get an abortion must be prosecuted and sent to jail since she has committed murder. They consider abortion to be an act of infanticide. They also believe that when a woman suffer a miscarriage, since it cannot be determined if it was truly a miscarriage or a botched abortion, it is better that the woman be tried and sent to jail as a warning rather than take a chance that her miscarriage was genuine. As far as they are concerned, abortion must be punished as severely as possible and if that means that women who suffer miscarriage must also be punished to send a message, then so be it. Now, in the U.S., we already have Republican states such as Texas which have passed six weeks abortion bans as well as allowing ordinary citizens to sue anyone who get an abortion or doctors who perform an abortion. There have already been calls by some Pro-Life/Anti-Abortions groups to go even further and actually begin prosecuting women who get abortions. Their argument is that since abortion is murder, it would be logically consistent to prosecute any woman who get an abortion or anyone who help her get an abortion since both the woman and the people who help her are murdering an unborn life. In 2022 Before the Midterm, Lindsay Graham introduced a National Bill that would restrict Abortions up to 15 weeks for all states and also allow for Further restrictions in the future to be enacted. Therefore, No States run by Democrats would be allowed to pass laws allowing for abortions after 15 weeks. The bill has exemptions for cases of rape (including statutory rape), incest and when ""necessary to save the life of a pregnant woman."" That life exemption notes that it doesn't apply to ""psychological or emotional conditions."" However, The rape exemption requires the patient to prove they obtained medical treatment or counseling or reported it to law enforcement at least 48hrs before the abortion. Furthermore, the rape exception for minors only applies if the doctor gets documentation from law enforcement reporting a rape. You can read the bill here: https://twitter.com/AliceOllstein/status/1569718736902307845?cxt=HHwWioCy5fu34cgrAAAA Graham stated that this bill could serve as a Template for a future Republican Trifecta in order to set the stage for Banning All Abortions at a future time. With Republicans passing more and more restrictions in states that they control, will Republicans eventually adopt policies such as prosecuting and sending women to Jail who get abortions?",DarkPriestScorpius,2024/1/18 21:15,101,60,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/199pwkv/in_el_salvador_women_who_get_abortions_or/,https://reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/199pwkv/in_el_salvador_women_who_get_abortions_or/,,,,,,,

On the one hand, he has made a name for himself many times, did improve on the Dems' margin in both his races compared to previous contests, and is fairly young (it'll be 18 years until he's 70). On the other hand, he's been politically jobless for almost six years by now, has lost both his statewide races, was in the middle of the pack in 2022, and has said more than enough about guns to be used against him by Republican opponents.

PoliticalDiscussion,1e460y0,What explains the wide polling gap between the presidential race and senate races?,"In my daily [RCP poll](https://www.realclearpolling.com/latest-polls) check, I was startled to see such a massive gap between the low public support for re-electing Biden and the solid public support for Democratic Senate candidates. In every single Senate race polled by both *YouGov* and the *NY Times,* Democrats had substantial leads well outside the Margin of Error, while Biden was only leading Virginia by 2 points while trailing the rest. **FYI: both polls were conducted before the assassination attempt.** On the flipside, Virginia Republican Senate Candidate Hung Cao, who has both an immigrant and military background, trails Democratic Senator Tim Caine by a blowout 17 points, 53% to 36%. I would think both attributes above would help Mr Cao (who also lost a house race), but apparently not. To further elaborate with the *YouGov* poll, Biden trails Trump 44% to 37% in Arizona while Democrat Ruben Gallego leads MAGA-aligned Republican Kari Lake 48% to 41%. In Michigan, Trump Leads Biden 42% to 40%, while Democrat Elissa Slotkin leads Old-school Republican Mike Rogers 48% to 39%. Neither Democrat is an incumbent senator. So what exactly is going on here? What makes Biden so much more unpopular than all these other Democrats? Is it perhaps about Trump's unique charisma, since he outpolls both populist Republicans like Lake and Old-school Republicans like Rogers, or some other reason? Finally, who exactly are these Trump-Dem Senator voters? I really am curious! I cannot understand this phenomenon, since it cuts across multiple states.

I am talking about what people are *comfortable* with. I am talking about someone who moves cities/states a handful of times in their life, as many Americans do, settles down somewhere, gets involved in the community, and decides to run for office. I am not talking about who you would vote for in trying to find the least bad option. But given a wide array/spectrum of candidates to choose from, what's the minimum amount of time you'd be willing to vote for? If this varies in terms of how far away someone has lived/same state/nearby state/far away state, please specify that as well. Do you care more about state borders, or economic/cultural boundaries within the United States? Do you believe that **only** locally born or locally raised residents can be credible candidates for public office? If so, why? Could you not care less about any of this? Would you not mind voting for someone who just moved in from the other side of the country, so long as they represent your views well? Does age matter in this? Would a 30-year-old who moved to your area at age 15 get a free pass, while a 50-year-old who moved to your area at age 35 might not? Or vice versa? Generally speaking, are people moving *into* or *out of* your area? Do you live in a melting pot, or a pot of water? How well travelled are you? Have you lived in the same area your entire life?

PoliticalDiscussion,1ecurld,What does the current state of polls tells us about the presidential race?,"I ask this question in part because it seems to be an unusually difficult race to get a gauge on with additional variables or factors to consider. It's quite the challenge to [Lichtman's model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Keys_to_the_White_House). Important related question I'd like to include here: Can it be expected that polls near election day will underestimate the Republican candidate as it did the last 2 presidential elections, particularly in swing states? I detail some of the arguments for/against that below. Could it be as likely or more to underestimate the Democratic candidate? The post-Biden decision polls that are out show Trump up about 1 over Harris nationally. General conventional wisdom is Harris would need to win by 2 points or more nationally, so she'd need a 3 point swing to be about even. The tipping point states are arguably the upper midwest WI/MI/PA trio, and she's down maybe an average of 2 points there, although this is based on only 2 polls this week. [https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/) Current polling could be artificially slanted in one direction by: 1. The terrible media cycle Democrats are just coming off of. 2. The good cycle Trump has had, including the RNC convention and positive coverage from getting shot at. 3. Potential democratic voters still weighing likely nominee Harris. 4. The generally positive coverage this week for Democrats and renewed enthusiasm. 5. The scrutiny of a very questionable VP pick JD Vance, who has ties to Project 2025, ""childless cat , lady""/""miserable at their own lives"" comments resurfacing. Which of these factors do you think are most significant? Others? Next, how are polls likely to shift over the next few months? Some factors: 1. Democratic convention 2. Ad spending in swing states 3. Debates 4. Third party votes peeling off in one direction or the other. Which direction is likely? 5. Undecideds committing Others? Lastly, there are generally 2 schools of though regarding how polls are likely to be slanted. Which is more likely? 1. Poll bias (in the aggregates) has about the same chance of being biased towards Harris as Trump. Polls often underestimate Democrats - to at least a small extent in 2022, 2018 and 2012. Pollsters often adjust methodology when getting things wrong. 2. Poll aggregates will underestimate Trump support again. It happened twice. Persistent problems, like the pool of people who don't respond to polls being weighted towards Trump supporters, particularly on phone-based polls, have not been corrected. No indication any dynamics or polling methodology has changed. Good background on 2020 on why polls missed by a few points: [https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/11/10/21551766/election-polls-results-wrong-david-shor](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/11/10/21551766/election-polls-results-wrong-david-shor) If one assumes that Harris will gain some ground through the convention, she could be even or a favorite going into the fall if #1 holds. If the truth is closer to #2, she's likely still an underdog, perhaps a significant one. I guess the key questions I have here: Is there any indication pollster methodology has shifted to address the problems in 2020/2016 and have any other dynamics shifted?",gmb92,2024/7/27 02:06,95,213,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1ecurld/what_does_the_current_state_of_polls_tells_us/,https://reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1ecurld/what_does_the_current_state_of_polls_tells_us/,,,,,,,

PoliticalDiscussion,1gs628t,What is the likely outcome of the 2026 US Senate elections?,"The 2024 US Senate election was highly unfavourable for Democrats as they lost 3 seats (Montana, Ohio and West Virginia) and are likely to lose another in Pennsylvania depending on recounts. Therefore, they will have 47 seats (including Sanders and King) to the Republicans 53 seats in the next Congress. So they will need a net gain at least 4 seats in 2026 to become the majority party. The 2026 US Senate map is much more favourable to Democrats compared to 2024. In 2026, only 13 Democratic held seats up for election compared to 20 for Republicans (22 if you include JD Vance?™s Ohio seat and Marco Rubio?™s Florida seat). In addition, the 2026 election cycle is a during a midterm election hence the opposing party to the president usually performs well. Most seats up for election are uncompetitive so the Republicans should retain: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida (special election - Rubio?™s seat), Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia and Wyoming. This leaves them on 49 seats. Likewise the Democrats should retain: Colorado, Delaware, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island and Virginia. This leaves them on 45 seats. Therefore, there are 6 seats up for grabs including: Georgia, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, North Carolina and Ohio (special election - JD Vance?™s seat). Democrats need to win all 6 just to get a majority which is challenging. Georgia and Michigan are likely to remain Democratic. North Carolina has the potential to flip to the Democrats and they have ran close in the last few elections. Maine should be an easy Democratic win is complicated by the fact that Susan Collins is running for re-election and is popular in their state. Iowa is difficult and could only be flipped in a blue wave election. Ohio is trending Republican but if Sherod Brown stands, the Democrats have a chance to flip the state.

So why is it not being used as an example for future debates? They truly did a good job. Do you think modern debaters could learn something from the past?

PoliticalDiscussion,1dtd1k4,Why is elite Democratic opinion so eager to dump Biden?,"According to many Democratic elite opinion as expressed by analysts like Nate Silver and opinion columnists like NYT's Tom Friedman, Biden is now a liability to winning the presidential election against Trump. Even though they have defended Biden before the debate, now that he has been exposed as having at least difficulty expressing himself and at worst in cognitive decline as expressed in sundowning, they are ready to dump him pronto. However, this desire to get rid of their party's candidate is unusual in that even if the trailing candidate ultimately loses in November, party faithful usually sticks with the candidate until the end. Republicans supported GHW Bush, Dole and McCain even though they were likely to lose and expressed no indicating of dumping them even though their trailed significantly. Likewise, Democrats backed Carter in 1980 and Mondale in 1984 against Reagan and Dukakis against GHW Bush in 1988 even though it was predictable that their candidates would lose. There was no indication that the party should replace them either before or after the convention. Why are Democrats, especially elite opinion, so eager to dump Biden and replace him with basically anyone from Harris to Whitmer to Newsom? Does the effort hurt Biden's chances more than it helps if he refuses to yield? What should Republicans take from this effort to on the part of Democrats?

PoliticalDiscussion,1ac3ryd,Has Trump gained new voters since 2020?,"Normally when a president or candidate loses an election, as Trump did in 2020, they fade into the political wilderness and lose influence within their party and nationally, making it unlikely for them to seek office again. Trump however has had remarkable staying power within the Republican party, though with far more notable internal critics than normal for an ex-president. Biden's job approval and popularity have fallen over the course of his term, such that his ~~approval~~ favorability* ratings are now matching that of the unfavorable/favorable ratings of Trump in a [recent Gallup poll](https://news.gallup.com/poll/548138/american-presidential-candidates-2024-election-favorable-ratings.aspx) published Jan 9th: Donald Trump - Favorable: 42%, Unfavorable: 57% Joe Biden - Favorable: 41%, Unfavorable: 58% However Joe Biden's ratings appear to have been a more recent loss among younger voters in the wake of the Oct 6th attack on Israel by Hamas, maintaining around 47% with 55+ voters versus 30% with under 35 and 40% with 35 to 54 year old voters, for an 8% loss among those two age groups and a 1% uptick among 55+ voters. Donald Trump's on the other hand appears to have consistent favorability ratings between 37 to 42% post presidency with all age groups, with a slight uptick in the latest polling. Has Trump made a good case to American voters for why they should hand him a win against a candidate he previously lost to?

PoliticalDiscussion,1esl2z1,Can someone explain how a character like Mark Robinson is able to get elected to Lieutenant Governor in a state like North Carolina?,"To begin with, any number of ""How did this happen"" questions can be asked when it comes to Trumpism, and I hope to distinguish this question from the vast majority of them. In terms of how people vote, North Carolina is relatively evenly split, and you could probably describe it as an occasional swing state. It generally leans Republican, but was carried by Obama in 2008 and has a 2-term democratic governor. At the state level, the Democrats largely dominated a decade and a half ago. In the past few election cycles, some very non-mainstream Republican candidates have lost, or simply got walloped in the more ""True"" swing states. These include the likes of Doug Mastriano and Kari Lake. Mark Robinson, to detail a portion of the record, has: -Repeatedly expressed apparent Holocaust skepticism or denial, referring to Hitler's forcing of Jews into concentration camps as ""hogwash"" -Has referred to LGBTQ people, or the state of being LGBTQ, as ""Filth"", among similar statements -You can go watch his speech from June 30 about how ""Some folks need killin"" -Has called school shooting survivors ""Spoiled, angry, know-it-all children"" and ""Media prosti-tots"" -He has promoted various conspiracy theories, including on the attack on Paul Pelosi I won't continue, that's probably enough of an illustration. In 2020, he ran for Lieutenant Governor of North Carolina. He won the Republican primary with 32.5% of the vote, and the general election, against a democrat, with 51.6% of the vote. He is the current Lieutenant Governor of the North Carolina, serving under a 2-term Democratic Governor, Roy Cooper. He is now running for Governor of North Carolina. He won the Republican primary with 64.8% of the vote. The most recent batch of polling has him trailing Democratic AG Josh Stein by 4-10 percentage points. History has so far shown that Trump's ""Teflon"" ability to shake off past controversies and scandals is not automatically or universally shared. JD Vance has a much lower favorability than Trump does. Doug Mastriano lost in Pennsylvania by 16 points. Desantis may be Teflon in Florida, but not outside of it. Search the fine print, and you'll probably find countless more examples. Trump is the master of his own brand, and the countless attempts to emulate it vary in outcome. Put simply, how did Mark Robinson get here in the first place? How did he assemble a coalition that elected him as Lieutenant Governor, in a state like North Carolina? Why does that coalition appear to be lacking in the present moment, when it wasn't four years ago?",Loraxdude14,2024/8/15 11:23,92,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1esl2z1/can_someone_explain_how_a_character_like_mark/,https://reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1esl2z1/can_someone_explain_how_a_character_like_mark/,,,,,,,

What could be more undemocratic???So he seems to be saying that having a bicameral legislature, a requirement for laws to be signed by the head of state, and a constitution which prevents the passing of policies which go against it, enforced by a head of state appointed body??Are inherently incompatible with a democratic government?

PoliticalDiscussion,1amdd8x,Why Are Democrats So Bad at Touting Their Economic Success?,"Since 1933, there has been a consistent trend in the United States economy: significant economic growth tends to occur under Democratic administrations. According to a recent analysis by The New York Times, the economy has expanded at an annual average rate of 4.6 percent under Democratic presidents, compared to just 2.4 percent under Republicans. Let's put that into perspective: if the economy had grown at the Democratic rate for the past nine decades, the average income of Americans would be more than double its current level. This isn't just a statistical anomaly; it's a tangible reflection of the policies and leadership styles implemented by each party. To delve deeper into the data, it's striking to note that the six presidents overseeing the fastest job growth were all Democrats. Conversely, the four presidents associated with the slowest growth have all been Republicans. These are not mere coincidences but rather patterns that reveal the impact of different political ideologies on economic outcomes. Historically, the United States economy has fared better, on average, when Democrats have held the presidency compared to periods under Republican leadership. This trend holds over the last several decades, with ten out of eleven recessions between 1953 and 2020 beginning under Republican administrations. However, despite the facts and data, the American people today have stated they still would trust Donald Trump and the Republicans to manage the economy over Joe Biden and the Democrats. When looking at the facts, this really should not even be a debate. Moreover, despite a STRONG jobs report in January, there are still many Americans who question whether or not President Biden is capable of managing our economy. How could this be despite the recent and historical successes Democrats have had in managing the economy?

In addition, it closes the border if 5K reach it in a day, which happened on the watch of both Trump and Biden administrations. Some on the right find this insufficient. Also some central and South American migrants are still allowed under asylum to stay before a review.

PoliticalDiscussion,1h1lu9i,"What impacts do you all think Trump?™s new tariff proposals will have on the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and China?","Trump recently announced a new blanket tariff of 25% on all Canadian and Mexican goods and a 10% blanket tariff on all Chinese goods. Trump?™s goal for the Chinese tariff is to incentivize the Chinese government to help prevent the flow of illegal drugs and to bring outsourced jobs back to the U.S., specifically in manufacturing, and his goal for the Canadian and Mexican tariffs is to incentivize their governments to better secure their borders, reduce the flow of drugs, and bring outsourced jobs back into the U.S. According to Pew Research, Mexican illegal immigration has fallen since 2007, while illegal immigration from other countries has increased over the last four years. Many illegal immigrants crossing the southern border are fleeing from third-world countries in Central and South America, such as El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Venezuela. Will imposing tariffs on Mexico have a significant impact on illegal immigration? Do you think these tariffs will accomplish Trump?™s goals? What industries could be impacted by these tariffs? Could these tariffs spark a trade war? Why do you think Trump is taxing Canadian imports when illegal immigration to the U.S. from Canada is far less severe than illegal immigration from the Mexican border? For those of you who support Trump?™s latest tariff proposals, why do you support them, and what positive impacts do you think they will have? For those who oppose Trump?™s latest tariff proposals, why do you oppose them, and what negative impacts do you think they will have?

PoliticalDiscussion,1fmgdfh,Where is American Polarization Heading?,"Biden ran on a platform of healing America. Four years in, it is unclear if he has accomplished his goal. The right is arguably more radicalized than ever. The liberal coalition is more complicated with perhaps less political ambition than in 2020 but also a more solidified progressive wing angry at the current status-quo. Like most historical trends though it is hard to judge success in the moment. The question I would have is, are the conditions for depolarization established and if so what does that mean. The Right: (Potential lines of inquiry) 1. Will the right accept defeat in 2024 if it comes or try to take a more militant stance? 2. If the right wins will it attempt to win a larger coalition by moderating its views or embrace a vision of overthrowing the status-quo? e.g the 2025 plan 3. Has the experience of running unelectable candidates in winnable states (Lake, Robinson) begun to sour the right on a lack of political pragmatism? 4. Will the right fight or concede on it's unpopular stance on trying to limit abortion? The Left: 1. Will the Liberal-Left try to push America towards a more progressive cultural understanding or attempt to consolidate post 2010s gains at the expense of further equity efforts or concede some post 2010s gain in an effort to gain control of the center? 2. Will the Liberal-Left coalition break apart or stay together over differences on issues like Israel? 3.

PoliticalDiscussion,1eu8hlr,"How do Democrats defeat the ""Two Santas Strategy?""","The Two Santas Strategy was published by Jude Wanniski in 1976: > But as the Two-Santa Claus Theory holds that the Republicans should concentrate on tax-rate reduction. As they succeed in expanding incentives to produce, they will move the economy back to full employment and thereby reduce social pressures for public spending. Just as an increase in Government spending inevitably means taxes must be raised, a cut in tax rates?”by expanding the private sector?”will diminish the relative size of the public sector. In practice, the Two-Santa Claus Theory is: 1. When Republicans control the White House they must spend money like a drunken Santa and cut taxes to run up the U.S. debt as far and as fast as possible. This produces three results: a. By not arguing to cut spending but offering the option of cutting taxes, Republicans transform from Scrooge worried about spending to a Santa Claus offering tax cuts vs Democrat's Santa Claus offering spending programs. b. It stimulates the economy, improving public opinion about the Republican's handling of the economy. c. It raises the debt. 2. When a Democrat is in the White House, Republicans must scream about the national debt as loudly and frantically as possible, including shutting down the government and damaging U.S. credibility, and try to put the blame on Democrats spending. 3. Claim to voters that Democrats are out of control and only Republicans can fix it by lowering taxes further. Jude Wanniski thought Democrats would never win again because they'd be forced into the role of Santa Claus killers if they acted responsibly by raising taxes or cutting spending on their own social programs.

PoliticalDiscussion,1du1i20,Trump verdict delayed,"In light of the recent Supreme court ruling regarding presidential immunity for official acts, the judge in trump's Hush money trial in which Trump was found guilty delayed the sentencing for a couple of months. Even though this trial involved actions prior to Trumps presidency, apparently it involved evidence that came from Trump's tweets during his presidency and Trump's lawyers tried to present those tweets as official acts during his presidency. This is likely why the judge will evaluate this and I suspect if and when Trump is sentenced he will take this to the Supreme Court and try and claim that the conviction should be thrown out because it involved ""official"" acts during his presidency. Does anybody think this is legit? A tweet is an official act? Judge Merchan expressed skepticism, saying that tweets are not official acts, and they don't see how a tweet is an official act, rather than a personal one. Did the tweet come from a government account, and thus , makes it official since it came from an ""official"" government account? Are any accounts from government officials on social media sites considered official government channels and any posting of messages therein considered official acts? I know that the Supreme Court punted the decision of determining what constitutes ""official"" acts back down to the lower courts, but surely those decisions will be challenged as well, and the Supreme Court will likely be the ones to determine what official acts are. If they determine that a presidents social media postings are official acts, could the New York verdict be thrown out? What do you all think?

Would this ruling be more acceptable to Republicans? Edit: I've going to paraphrase what I feel are some of the best comments below.

PoliticalDiscussion,1gng8fd,"What will be the economic, social and political impacts of Trump's mass deportation policy? Will it even go as far as advertised?","One of Trump's signature campaign policies is a mass deportation plan for undocumented migrants that far dwarfs any previous immigration crackdown on U.S. history. One that if carried out as advertised, could have significant economic, social and political impacts. In terms of economics, there is potential for such a crackdown to have [significantly effects on the agricultural and construction sectors](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/trump-mass-deportation-pledge-faces-legal-economic-barriers-4731381) that rely heavily on migrant labor. What is the potential for mass deportation to cause an inflationary spike on the economy not soon after Trump was elected on the back of discontent over inflation? Socially, Trump owed his victory to support from Latino voters, be it Mexican-Americans who are legal citizens that strongly dislike illegal immigration from Central America, or Guatemalan and Honduran migrants that genuinely believe Trump is blustering. If Trump goes as far as stated with deportation, is there a risk of eroding that support, particularly if legal migrants and naturalized citizens are caught up in the deportations as advocates have warned? Would it potentially lead to the pendulum swinging back in favor of pro-immigration sentiment much like the [family separation policy](https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383845/trump-mass-deportations-immigration-family-separation) did during Trump's first term? Politically, how would Trump try to negotiate with Mexico, Guatemala and other Latin American countries in trying to get them to accept deported migrants back? How would those migrants be sheltered and cared for while awaiting deportation? Finally, there has been talk as to whether Trump can even accomplish such a massive immigration crackdown. Aside from the sheer logistics in terms of manpower and resources needed to carry out such a task, there are other obstacles from [litigation in immigration courts](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/07/trump-immigrant-advocates-battle-00187971), to companies trying to plead for exemptions in their particular sectors. Then there is the influence of Trump's longtime adviser and architect on immigration policy Stephen Miller, who among other things had advocated sinking [migrant boats with drones](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/27/trump-stephen-miller-migrants-boats-drone-attacks-book) and supports [denaturalization](https://x.com/StephenM/status/1712094935820780029?lang=en) or stripping natural-born citizens of their rights. Would Trump inevitably balk at the sheer logistical, legal and economic challenges of pursuing mass deportation enough that he just does the classic Trump overpromising and underdelivering by deporting a few migrants before declaring Mission Accomplished?

This meant that had Kerry won Ohio - which he lost by only a little over 100k votes, a fraction of Bush's popular vote margin - he would have won the election while losing the popular vote, the first time for a Democrat and likely the last time such an outcome was close to feasible for a Democrat to pull off.

He sowed distrust and anxiety among our allies across the globe and consistently frustrated his political allies. His history before politics is similarly unsavory, with all the scandals expected of a New York real estate tycoon/playboy who studded his career with controversy and open combat with the media. He's also probably having one of the best weeks of his political life and is favored to return to the White House after his opponent Joe Biden, who is generally considered a morally upright man even among his political opponents, had an especially poor first debate performance due to his advanced age. The substance of the debate was probably average as far as the substantive answers Biden gave to the moderators' questions, but his voice was hoarse and his verbal cadence was muddled. He recovered somewhat later in the debate, however the damage was done. My question is: whether in the context of a debate or in the general race to the White House, Donald Trump by rights has far more baggage, far more risk, and far fewer factual answers to America's problems.

PoliticalDiscussion,1gaj7wm,How likely are we to see an election mirage in 2024?,"In the 2020 election, we saw what is now referred to as a Red mirage, because Trump had come out strongly against early and mail in voting in 2020, where as Biden endorsed it, we saw an interesting phenomenon: On election night 2020, things seemed to be going well for Trump, because election day votes were tallied first, and among election day voters, Trump was in the lead. However, once early and mail in ballots were counted, Trumps lead disappeared and he lost. Due to covid, 2020 saw huge amounts of early voting, mail in voting, and lots of voting other than election day. Now that we are back in ""normal"" times, how likely is a mirage of any sorts on election night 2024? Especially since this time around Trump is not crusading against early voting, but has infact endorsed it, lots of states that made voting easier during covid have tightened up laws, and no outbreak of disease making people afraid of crowds.

While the 2020 election was based on the 2010 census, the upcoming 2024 election will be based on the recent 2020 census. All evidence points to this favoring Republicans over Democrats: # Gained Seats: 1. **Texas**: +2 (from 38 to 40) 2. **Florida**: +1 (from 29 to 30) 3. **North Carolina**: +1 (from 15 to 16) 4. **Colorado**: +1 (from 9 to 10) 5. **Montana**: +1 (from 3 to 4) 6. **Oregon**: +1 (from 7 to 8) # Lost Seats: 1. **California**: -1 (from 55 to 54) 2. **New York**: -1 (from 29 to 28) 3. **Illinois**: -1 (from 20 to 19) 4. **Pennsylvania**: -1 (from 20 to 19) 5. **Ohio**: -1 (from 18 to 17) 6. **Michigan**: -1 (from 16 to 15) 7. **West Virginia**: -1 (from 5 to 4) Let's account for the current political leanings of each state: **RIGHT** (+3): Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Montana, Ohio, West Virginia **LEFT** (-1): Colorado, Oregon, California, New York, Illinois **SWING** (-2): Pennsylvania, Michigan All else equal, Republicans have a +4 advantage due to population changes alone.

PoliticalDiscussion,1dm2hxo,"Do Americans typically feel they have to ""respect the office"" of the Presidency?","Apologies in advance if I come across like I'm just looking to engage in some mindless US-bashing. This is just something that occurred to me recently and I wanted to check whether my perception was accurate. I'm not American - I live in New Zealand - and with the US Presidential debate coming up next week I was thinking back to the one in 2020 which was generally met with a very negative perception, and wondering why it turned out that way. Comparing it to the debates we had over here with our Prime Ministerial candidates, it seems the main difference is the respectfulness of the moderator. Ostensibly, a respectful moderator you'd think would be a good thing. But in the American Presidential debates, if I'm remembering correctly, the moderator kept having to say, ""Please, sir... sir, please... sir, I'm going to have to ask again, if I may ask my question, sir..."" and calling Trump ""Mr. President"", which takes quite a long time to say, especially when you're trying to shut somebody up so you can get on with a debate. My theory is that the moderator's behaviour was related to attitudes I've heard various Americans express over the years, which is that you have to pay the President a certain amount of respect, because they *are* the President. ""It's about the Office,"" I've heard them say. My understanding of US history is that the office of the Presidency was partly meant to replace the British monarchy, and so as a result it's inherited some of that symbolic and ceremonial baggage. American Presidents are viewed as symbolic figureheads of the country. Compare this to what we have in my country (NZ). I don't think we really view our Prime Minister as anything other than a politician who got elected to govern the country, and that's it (although we sometimes start hero-worshipping them if they turn out to be inspiring or whatever, but it's not really about ""the Office""). They're an individual chosen by a parliamentary majority to form a government. They're regularly lambasted and aggressively criticized to their face in Parliament. In our debates in 2020, it was generally agreed that for the purposes of the debate, the moderator was King. You can see a good example of his approach [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50FHR7h3k8A&t=3333s) (from about 55:33 until about 56:50). Quite sarcastic and arguably rude. But he keeps the candidates in-line. So it occurred to me that the reason for this difference is the American attitude of respect for the office of President that requires a debate moderator to be overly cautious and courteous. No matter how out-of-line the President is, you have to pay him respect, the Office comes with a certain level of decorum. But on the other hand, I might be completely wrong about this? Is this actually a common attitude in America? From what I've seen online, a lot of Americans have no problem being extremely rude about the President if they dislike him. Is it perhaps a more old-fashioned attitude that prevails in polite society, but isn't common for most Americans? Or is it something that's ingrained into you like a belief in the Constitution, the Pledge of Allegiance and so on?",Wooba12,2024/6/23 02:44,68,130,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1dm2hxo/do_americans_typically_feel_they_have_to_respect/,https://reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1dm2hxo/do_americans_typically_feel_they_have_to_respect/,,,,,,,

At most maybe remembering that Harrison got the job because of weird electoral college results, Arthur came about because Garfield who was not an orange cat was shot and Alexander Graham Bell's metal detector failed to work for him, and Harrison was the grandson of the shortest ruling president. The gilded age brought in the period when America's economic growth would make it the biggest economic power in the world, would give America its navy and influence around its immediate sphere in North America, it's dominance over Latin America that used to be more balanced out by Brazil and other powers, it's forays into the Pacific and tensions with Japan and the Kingdom of Hawaii, the way oligarchic corporations became national forces and the way America brutally suppressed Indian populations who were still independent. In Canada, remembering who people like Prime Minister Robert Borden were is also easily forgotten despite the way the First World War so dramatically changed Canada. Napoleon III is definitely not remembered the way his monumentally famous uncle very much so still is despite how the tensions growing under his rule helped to characterize socialism and what would become French republicanism that prevailed from his deposition onwards, and Napoleon's empire around the world would ironically be a far more long lasting one than the one his uncle effected, like his foreign policy against Russia in Crimea, fighting Mexico for debt payments taking advantage of America being in a civil war too weak to enforce the Monroe Doctrine, and his empire around Africa and the seeds of Vietnam's subjugation, which became enormously important generations later (and at the time to the Vietnamese people of course).

Therefore, can Europe on its own, without the US, stop the nightmare scenario where in a few years Russian T-90s cross into the Baltic States while Russian missiles hit Berlin, Paris, and other European cities?

That seems to be a situation with too many factors to gain meaningful insight. Instead should Democrats look at the seemingly anti-Progressive election results in California as their baseline in re-strategizing themselves? California saw the successful recall of Oakland Mayor Shang Thao and Alameda County DA Pamela Price. Both seen as having Progressive platforms. LA County DA Gascon lost his re-election bid and was also a Progressive DA. And 2 years ago progressive SF DA Chelsea Boudin was recalled. On the Proposition side, there were many Proposition victories I think can be considered non-Progressive. * Banning prison labor failed (Prop 6) * Harsher crime penalties passed easily (Prop 36) * Rent control failed (Prop 33) * Increasing minimum wage failed (Prop 32) * Prop 34 is generally accepted as an attack against the AIDS Healthcare Foundation who opponents see as Progressive political machine acting outside its mandate. This passed. Taking this at face value, it seems there is still tolerance for Democrat politicians but the progressiveness has gone too far out of sync with the average voter.

PoliticalDiscussion,1f8vviy,Are Parties and PACs spending too much time on the Presidential election and ignoring key Senate races?,"While it's fascinating to watch the projections move in the Presidential race, it's important to note the precarious lead currently held by the Democrats, and the potential outcome of the various Senate races this year. Currently, Republicans hold 49 Senate seats, Democrats hold 47 seats, and Independents (who caucus with Democrats) hold 4 seats, giving the Democrats a 51-49 advantage. This advantage is complicated when Independents like Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema tend to lean conservative on a number of votes. In the upcoming 2024 race, 19 Democratic seats are up for grabs, along with 10 Republican seats and all 4 Independent seats. According to aggregated poll results, most of these races will keep the status quo, with a few exceptions: - Jon Tester from Montana (D) is currently a little behind Tim Sheehy in Montana, which would flip one seat Republican. - Manchin (I) is not running for reelection, and will likely be replaced by Jim Justice (R). Sort of a half-flip. With these changes, a Republican-majority Senate would be able to block even basic budget legislation and effectively stymie a Democratic White House. If Trump wins in 2024, Republicans will have the White House, the House of Representatives and the Senate, similar to 2017. There are a few races that are close enough to potentially swing, but it would take massive political effort. - The Tester/Sheehy race is one of the closest Senate races, with Tester behind in the polls by 2.5% - In Florida, Rick Scott is projected to beat Debbie Murcasel-Powell, but only by a few percentage points. - In Pennsylvania, Bob Casey is projected to keep his Democratic Senate seat over Dave McCormick, but could be ousted with a Republican push in that state. - In Texas, Collin Allred trails Ted Cruz by about 6%. He could conceivably pull an upset. These four or five races will be vital in determining the overall balance of the Senate. It's surprising that I see very little emphasis being put on these races versus the Presidential election. For anyone who lives in these areas, are you seeing a massive campaign effort for/against Tester or Sheehy? Scott or Murcasel-Powell? Casey or McCormick?

Concerns regarding messaging were raised, including the perception of apathy by the Republican Party and changing demographics that the party was not reaching. It recommended increased focus on criticizing big business and demonstrating concern for poorer Americans. > The report found that ""the perception that the GOP does not care about people is doing great harm to the Party and its candidates on the federal level, especially in presidential years.""[1] It emphasized directing messaging toward Hispanic and Latino Americans when considering changing demographics, emphasizing the increasing Hispanic population in the United States and urging the party to limit its rhetoric on immigration policy. It also recommended appealing to younger voters by reducing social conservatism in the party.[3] > The report emphasized the importance of appealing to African-American, Latino, Asian, women, gay, and young voters, citing changing demographics and the increased skepticism these groups held toward the Republican Party. It warned that the increasing non-white population in the United States threatened to make elections more difficult for Republicans if the party did not attempt to reach these voters.

In both states, electoral votes are allocated to each congressional district. Whenever wins the popular vote in those districts wins that district?™s electoral vote into. The remaining 2 votes (dubbed senatorial votes), are given to the winners of the state wide popular vote. This is why District 2 of Maine, a rural conservative district, always votes red.

Of its 3 districts, 2 are rural while 1, Lincoln, is liberal. So the Dems often (not always) win the district Lincoln is in only while the other two and the senatorial votes go red (the state itself is majority conservative). If all states adopted this model, it would give political minorities an actual voice/representation. For example: conservative districts in the east of California, Oregon, Washington.

And I assume the 2023 Israel-Hamas war is what pushed him down further over the last two months to 16 underwater. How well a politician is liked (regardless of job performance), isn't the only or main factor in the outcome of elections. But could improving his image among independent voters, for instance, get him wins in the swing states. Could him simply being more visible & vocal on the campaign trail be what gives him the edge?

Would be seen as a Conservative in the style of Ron DeSantis, or a RINO like Bush, Mitt Romney and Liz Cheney?","Reddit is Liberal/Left-leaning (and I am also), so naturally Ronald Reagan is not liked by Liberals. His reforms, his administration's scandals and social policy, etc. But - even Liberals today would agree that ""Reagan was bad, but at least he wasn't like Trump"". Trump is considered so bad that even Reagan is better than him. Now there are the obvious statements that Reagan was the one who laid the foundations for Trump - he took Nixon's goons and worked with the evangelists, the war on drugs and more and he also promoted racism. Reagan was like the GOP's Superman and is adored by them while is very criticized by Liberals. But, then Trump came. He copied Reagan's slogan - ""Make America Great Again"", pandered to the religious right, and played on the ""traditional values"" (though he is more of a Populist). Trump is now considered the Liberals' nightmare, someone who is worse than every other Republican and even worse than Reagan, who many believe was like Trump in some ways but with ""filters"" (and better hair) So Trump and Reagan however are different (for example their positions on Russia), but even if Liberals hate Reagan - for many of them he looks good suddenly in comparison to Trump. So my question is, if Reagan existed today (or a reincarnation of him) how would he be viewed by the MAGA crowd and what would he think about the Trump conservatives?

PoliticalDiscussion,1g18y0x,(New York Times) How One Polling Decision Is Leading to Two Distinct Stories of the Election. A methodological choice has created divergent paths of polling results. Is this election more like 2020 or 2022?,"***Source***: [*https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/06/upshot/polling-methods-election.html*](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/06/upshot/polling-methods-election.html) ***(Paywall)*** Over the last month, one methodological decision seems to have produced two parallel universes of political polling. In one universe, Kamala Harris leads only narrowly in the national popular vote against Donald J. Trump, even as she holds a discernible edge in the Northern battlegrounds. The numbers look surprisingly similar to the 2022 midterm election. In the other, Ms. Harris has a clear lead in the national vote, but the battlegrounds are very tight. It?™s essentially a repeat of the 2020 election. This divide is almost entirely explained by whether a pollster uses ?œweighting on recalled vote,??which means trying to account for how voters *say* they voted in the last election. Here?™s how it works. First, the pollster asks respondents whether they voted for Joe Biden or Mr. Trump in the last election. Then they use a statistical technique called weighting, in which pollsters give more or less ?œweight??to respondents from different demographic groups, such that each group represents its actual share of the population. In this case, the pollster weights the number of Biden ??0 or Trump ??0 voters to match the outcome of the last election. This approach had long been considered a mistake. For reasons we?™ll explain, pollsters have avoided it over the years. But they increasingly do it today, partly as a way to try to make sure they have enough Trump supporters after high-profile polling misfires in 2016 and 2020. The choice has become an important fault line among pollsters in this election, and it helps explain the whiplash that poll watchers are experiencing from day to day. **Over the last month, about two-thirds of polls were weighted by recalled vote.** An important ??and perhaps obvious ??consequence of weighting by recalled vote is that it makes poll results look more like the 2020 election results. The polls that don?™t do it\*,\* including New York Times/Siena College surveys, are more likely to show clear changes from four years ago. While the differences between the two sets of polls are relatively small, they add up to two different stories of the election. The polls that *don?™t* weight on past vote tend to show results that align more closely with the result of the 2022 midterm election than the last presidential election. They also show that Mr. Trump?™s advantage in the Electoral College, with respect to the popular vote, has dwindled over the last four years. The polls weighted on past vote, on the other hand, show little more than a 2020 repeat of the Electoral College gap. As we?™ll see, this is a fraught decision for pollsters. On one hand, weighting on recalled vote would have produced worse results in every presidential election from 2004 to 2020. On the other, it?™s the choice that might save pollsters from underestimating Mr. Trump yet again. **Why this kind of weighting is controversial** When I started following polling methodology debates 20 years ago, weighting on recalled vote was considered a very bad idea. A surprising number of respondents don?™t remember how they voted; they seem likelier to remember voting for the winner; and they sometimes report voting when voting records show they did not. This pattern has persisted all the way from the first time I read about recall vote all the way to the present, based on data archived at the Roper Center and 2021-24 data from the Pew Research Center and Times/Siena. The same pattern shows up in the exit polls in every presidential election year when it was asked (2004, 2008, 2020). The tendency for recall vote to overstate the winner of the last election means that weighting on recall vote has a predictable effect: It increases support for the party that lost the last election. While polls have a lot of issues, underestimating the party that lost the last election doesn?™t turn out to be one of them. As a result, weighting on recalled vote would have made the polls less accurate in every election since 2004 (the farthest back considered), based on a re-analysis of 70 polls archived at the Roper Center. The effect of recall vote in 2020 is especially revealing: The polls that year were so poor that there are individual cases where recall-vote weighting would have helped. For example, it would have produced a smaller lead for Mr. Biden in ABC/Washington Post?™s [infamous poll](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/10/28/power-up-new-post-abc-polling-shows-biden-with-big-lead-wisconsin-where-coronavirus-cases-are-rising/) showing him leading by 17 points in Wisconsin in October 2020. But it wouldn?™t have fixed it, either; by our estimate, it would have still shown Mr. Biden up 12 if recall vote had been used when producing the result. And it would have made most other 2020 polls less accurate, on average, including Times/Siena polls and most of the other ABC/Post polls. What does it mean if recall vote wouldn?™t have been enough to fix the polls four years ago? The most straightforward interpretation: For the 2020 polls to be right, pollsters needed the 2016 recall vote to look ?œwrong.??The polls needed Mr. Trump to hold a clear lead on recall vote ??exactly what one would have expected historically, given the tendency for recall vote to overstate the winner of the previous election. As a result, recalled vote didn?™t even help the polls in the biggest polling misfire in 40 years. **Why pollsters now weight on recall vote** Despite that record, many pollsters have decided to weight on recall vote for four main reasons. First, many pollsters believe recall vote is more reliable than it used to be. Whether it?™s accurate enough is another question, but it?™s certainly true that recall vote looks ?œcloser??to the last election result than in prior cycles. The last three years of Times/Siena and Pew Research NPORS data show about a three-point gap between recalled 2020 vote and the actual 2020 result, a far cry from the double-digit differences a decade or two ago. Why could recall vote be getting more accurate? One possibility is that poll respondents have become more likely to remember whom they voted for in the last election, thanks to rising political engagement and polarization. Another possibility is that data collected online may be less vulnerable to whatever it is that causes the ?œwinner bias??(importantly, almost all the reanalyzed polls ??where we produced estimates of what a poll?™s result might be if it had used recall-vote weighting ??were telephone surveys). This election also features a novel case: The loser of the last election is running again (and most Republicans don?™t even believe he lost), and the winner of the last election just lost a rematch, in a sense, against that loser. It?™s anyone?™s guess how all of this affects the accuracy of recall vote, but it is easy to imagine further mitigation of the traditional ?œwinner bias.??Second, some pollsters use panels of repeat survey-takers, which means they have responses from them over a long period. A pollster may have asked panelists in 2020 how they voted, as opposed to asking them today to remember how they voted four years ago. This counts as weighting on past vote, but it?™s not quite the same as someone?™s recalled vote. This approach ought to be less vulnerable to the biases in recall-vote weighting, even if there are still challenges involved ??like what to do about any new panelists or changes in the makeup of the electorate since 2020. Third, recall vote can be used to bludgeon self-evidently unrepresentative data toward a more plausible result. This is especially useful for survey designs with no plausible case for validity, like a poll of people from a single social media platform. No one expects such an approach to yield a good sample, but recall-vote weighting can quickly get it into the ballpark. Indeed, more than 80 percent of opt-in online panel polls weight on recall vote, while other kinds of polls are less likely to do so. Fourth, recall vote is being used to help address the tendency for polls to understate Mr. Trump?™s strength over the last eight years. As mentioned earlier, weighting on recall vote historically helps the candidate who lost the last election. This year, that?™s Mr. Trump. You can see it for yourself in the last round of Times/Siena battleground state polls ??almost all of them would have scooted to the right if they had been weighted by recall vote: **How recent Times/Siena polls would have changed** * Pennsylvania: Harris +4 (without recall vote) ?? Trump +1 (with recall vote) * Michigan: Harris +1 ?? Trump +1 * Wisconsin: Harris +2 ?? Trump +1 * North Carolina: Trump +3 ?? Trump +6 * Arizona: Trump +5 ?? Trump +3 * Georgia: Trump +4 ?? Trump +6 Of course, the recall-vote-weighted poll results here represent an entirely plausible outcome. If the polls underestimate Mr. Trump, as they did four or eight years ago, November?™s results might look exactly like this. But historically, it?™s not surprising that weighting on recall vote would help Republicans: Mr. Trump lost the last election; as such, weighting on recall vote would be expected to give more weight to Trump ??0 voters, and therefore to Mr. Trump today. When big-name traditional pollsters weight by recall vote, this is usually the reason. Some of these pollsters think it?™s a perfectly valid measure, but many only use it grudgingly. They still more or less believe the old arguments against recall vote, but they choose to employ it anyway. They wouldn?™t be doing it if they trusted their data to produce unbiased results, and they wouldn?™t be doing it if it didn?™t shift their polls toward Mr. Trump. As Patrick Murray of the Monmouth poll put it in [explaining](https://x.com/PollsterPatrick/status/1824477952043618633) his decision to weight on recall vote, ?œThe Trump phenomenon is sui generis, and you have to pick your poison.??**Did recall vote fix past problems?** There is some good news contained in this story: Recall-vote weighting is almost certainly reducing the risk that the polls systematically underestimate Mr. Trump, as they did in 2016 or 2020. As we?™ve shown, it has given many pollsters a quick and easy fix to move their numbers toward the right. Many of the worst survey results of the 2020 election seem unlikely to be repeated this time around. For instance, The Washington Post and CNN/SSRS state polls now weight by recall vote, which means we won?™t be seeing any results like Biden +17 in Wisconsin or Biden +16 nationwide. But there?™s a strange contradiction between the two major observations so far ??and the contradiction points toward real trade-offs involving recall-vote weighting. On the one hand, many pollsters are weighting on recall vote because it yields more Republican-leaning results. On the other, the polls weighted like this aren?™t necessarily producing especially Republican-leaning results. They don?™t look like the hypothetical recall-weighted Times/Siena polls, for instance. Instead, they?™re producing results neatly in line with the result of the 2020 election. **How is that possible? There are two basic possibilities.** One is that the polls weighted on recall vote are full of highly engaged voters who haven?™t shifted since 2020, and therefore weighting on recall vote will produce a 2020 repeat. Another possibility: It may be employed selectively by pollsters concerned their data is too far to the left. The two theories could be connected, as highly engaged voters have leaned left during the Trump era. Weighting on recall vote, then, would move a group of relatively Democratic-leaning samples neatly in line with the 2020 election result. Whatever the explanation, this tension suggests significant trade-offs as pollsters weight on recall vote. Most obviously, it may make it harder to identify any changes since the last election. One reason is simply because recall-vote weighting mechanically forces polls toward the last election result. But even deeper than that, the technique is being used, at least in part, because pollsters don?™t trust their survey results. It?™s an attitude that can lead pollsters to treat surprising and unusual data as suspicious, rather than potentially newsworthy or insightful. This is understandable: I know I don?™t always trust our survey results after the last decade of polling misfires. But when legitimate concern about polling morphs into weighting away otherwise outlying findings, it risks squelching any indication of anything that might be out of the ordinary. In a way, the problem is reminiscent of something [called ?œherding,?](https://aapor.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Herding-508.pdf) in which pollsters tweak their surveys to bring their results into alignment with the average of other polls. Like herding, the decision to weight on past vote is often a reflection of how pollsters feel about the quality of their underlying data. In this case, however, pollsters aren?™t necessarily herding toward what other pollsters say. Instead, they?™re essentially herding toward the result of the last presidential election. A near repeat of the last presidential election is certainly a plausible outcome. In today?™s polarized era, who could possibly be surprised by a repeat in Mr. Trump?™s third presidential run? If it?™s a near repeat, the polls weighted by recall vote won?™t just have an excellent night themselves, but they might also spare the entire industry another four years of misery. But if this election is different, in any direction, this year?™s polls might not be able to see it coming.",SillyGooseHoustonite,2024/10/11 20:46,61,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1g18y0x/new_york_times_how_one_polling_decision_is/,https://reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1g18y0x/new_york_times_how_one_polling_decision_is/,,,,,,,

A country of trillions of dollars of gross domestic product can certainly pay for all that if they wish. The biggest democratic legislature was the European Parliament until the British left, at 751 MEPs. The EU had the additional difficulty of simultaneous translation which is annoying but is less important in most other places, at most just a couple other languages that might need simulcasting. A big hall to fit them all isn't too bad either. Electronic voting systems can mean that they get through counting votes very quickly. You can guarantee outcomes of critical events through things like a ranked ballot to coerce the election of a speaker if they drag their heels. You can have committees do a lot of of the work through things like a scheduling committee to decide what goes on the agenda. You can have the legislators vote on a ballot paper each day as to who gets to speak during the limited time for debate. And a standing committee can be used for quick action in the most dire of times like the initial days of the 2020 pandemic, natural disasters, and war. &#x200B;",Awesomeuser90,2024/3/21 04:25,62,53,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1bjnf2g/how_big_can_a_legislature_get_and_remain_effective/,https://reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1bjnf2g/how_big_can_a_legislature_get_and_remain_effective/,,,,,,,

(this is from 11:40 to 12:30, taken from youtube's transcript) Shapiro's point is that, even though Trump was a president with ""a rhetoric he often didn't like"" (at 11:14), and who is prone to excesses, what he calls a robust and durable constitutional system will be fully capable of taking in and filtering out such excesses; and that because of such constitutional system, Trump will be a better president, even if he is not necessarily the best candidate personally. This claim has been corroborated frequently in this election cycle, by right wing pundits, as talking points by the media, etc. This is quite a strong claim to make, nonetheless. Should we judge *any* given candidate's capacity to serve *in light* of the American constitutional system?

PoliticalDiscussion,1eohqzg,"In a scenario where neither candidate gets to 270 electoral votes, and Harris wins the contingent election in the House of Representatives, if Republicans controlled the Senate, who would they choose for Vice President?","Some background--under the US constitution, if no candidate receives a majority of electoral votes in a presidential election (270), the house of representatives chooses the President in a ""contingent election"" where each state gets one vote (decided based on a majority of that state's delegation). The vice president is chosen by a simple majority vote of the Senate. While this isn't a likely scenario in 2024, I do think it is within the realm of ""reasonable possibility"" satisfying rule 5. Here is a somewhat realistic example map getting to 269-269: [https://www.270towin.com/maps/vDemb](https://www.270towin.com/maps/vDemb) There's another variation where Rs win everything they won last time, plus PA and MI but Dems win everything else that also gets to the same result. Importantly, the selection of the president and VP under this scenario would be done by the incoming (newly elected) Congress, not this one. So it's possible either party could control one or both branches, but to me the most interesting scenario is a split and the most likely one is where Dems control sufficient delegations in the House to choose Harris for President, but Republicans control the Senate and therefore can choose the VP. My question is, if this happened, who do you think Republicans would choose for VP and why? One obvious answer is to pick Vance since he is, after all, the party's VP nominee. But I imagine there might be pressure from the base to choose Trump since he's the one they want as close to the presidency as possible in case something were to happen to Harris. Or would they choose someone completely different? Bonus question--what if the reverse happened, Trump wins the election in the House but Dems control the Senate (I recognize this is a lot less likely)--who are they picking to be Trump's VP and why?",foxwilliam,2024/8/10 10:10,57,79,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1eohqzg/in_a_scenario_where_neither_candidate_gets_to_270/,https://reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1eohqzg/in_a_scenario_where_neither_candidate_gets_to_270/,,,,,,,

However, isn't the real problem that three large states of CA, MA and NY are overwhelmingly Democratic where even if all the electoral college votes go to the Democrat candidate, the lopsided nature of the populations in those states skew the popular vote totals. If those states vote for Biden 62-38, he will rack up millions of surplus votes, whereas if those states were more competitive, he would still win, but the popular vote wouldn't be as skewed toward the Democrats.

Notably, neither debate is sanctioned by the Commission for Presidential Debates, and they're set to happen much earlier in the cycle: the CPD's schedule would have seen three debates (plus one for VP nominees) between September 16 and October 9, while the two that the campaigns have agreed to so far will happen June 27 (on CNN) and September 10 (on ABC). Both campaigns had been saying for quite a while that they had issues with the CPD's debate formats, with Biden's people saying that the Commission was ""unable or unwilling to enforce the rules"" by allowing Trump to speak over Biden and the moderator, and Trump himself claiming that ""the Commission got caught cheating with [him]."" RFK Jr., meanwhile, is saying the two major parties are afraid of having him on the stage with their nominees, even though the CNN and ABC debates have more or less the same criteria for qualification as the CPD proposal (15% nationally in several polls; appear on enough state ballots that make it possible to win over 270 Electoral Votes). Do you think this change to the traditional debate format will have any meaningful impact on the race?

PoliticalDiscussion,1gvp5ay,To what degree do you think the system of recall should be used?,"IE the concept of having a vote among the electorate to dismiss a person from their position which they elected them to. A vote of no confidence is not usually a recall vote, unless it is directed internally among something like a university faculty if they elect the chancellor of a university or something on those lines. A typical recall vote is normally applied to a legislative or executive officer, sometimes judicial ones as well, and is initiated by a petition signed by some specified fraction of the electors, and then a referendum is held on whether or not to proceed with the recall, and if a specified number of voters agree, such as a majority of those who turn out, maybe a majority of all registered voters, whatever the law says, then the position is vacated and the mechanism to fill the vacancy occurs. It is one of the least common democratic mechanisms but is growing more common around the world. Japanese local officials can be subject to it, several German states allow it for the state parliament, Lithuania allows it for the parliament, LATAM is adopting it more and more, two Canadian provinces allow it, the UK allows it for MP misconduct, Romania and Iceland and Austria have a system where the parliament can initiate this mechanism for the presidents of those countries, and about half of American states permit it. I'm not sure how you would organize this in an electoral college system if a POTUS or VPOTUS was subjected to it, but I could engineer a solution, maybe 270 electors being pledged and if a state has X% for recall, then X% of the electors of that state are pledged to vote for recall.

PoliticalDiscussion,1b77bwj,How does the Supreme Court ruling concerning Trump's ballot eligibility affect state's ability to regulate who appears on the ballots in other ways?,"On March 4, the Supreme Court ruled that Colorado can not enforce the 14th amendment's insurrection clause to keep Trump off of the state ballot. [PDF of the ruling](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-719_19m2.pdf) Part of their reasoning was that each state may come to a different determination concerning insurrection, and we would end up with differing results in different states, calling it a ""patchwork"". >Indeed, in some States... procedures for excluding an ineligible candidate from the ballot may not exist at all. The result could well be that a single candidate would be declared ineligible in some States, but not others, based on the same conduct (and perhaps even the same factual record). But, we already have a ""patchwork"" of different regulations for who can appear on a ballot from state to state - signature requirements, fees, etc., which are definitely not in the constitution but are enforced by each state. [Chart per state.](https://ballotpedia.org/Ballot_access_for_presidential_candidates) Scroll down to ""Independent candidate ballot access requirements, 2024"" so we don't get bogged down in the political party ballot access process. Additionally, the qualifications specifically listed in the constitution - namely being 35 years old and a US citizen at birth - are determined by a state document. We don't have federal birth certificates. Essentially, one state can determine eligibility based on those particular factors. Why would someone who has been excluded from a state ballot not be able to challenge the state's enforcement power? How could a state enforce disqualification against anyone? How would we not end up with ballots that list thousands of names, whether they are constitutionally eligible or not? The decision yesterday relies on Section 5 of the [14th Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-14/#:~:text=No%20State%20shall%20make%20or,equal%20protection%20of%20the%20laws.), implying that it is up to congress to specifically handle the enforcement through legislation. >The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article. But, there are other parts of the 14th Amendment, namely Section 1, that are enforced by the courts without congress getting involved every time, so my understanding is that congress is *allowed* to enforce the 14th, but they aren't the *only* enforcement mechanism. The amendment says ""have power"" not ""have exclusive power"".",orrocos,2024/3/5 23:04,52,138,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1b77bwj/how_does_the_supreme_court_ruling_concerning/,https://reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1b77bwj/how_does_the_supreme_court_ruling_concerning/,,,,,,,

PoliticalDiscussion,1ccs7il,Is impeachment the sole remedy for election tampering and election denial?,"In the instant case being argued before the Supreme Court today, numerous briefs have filed that, in essence, argue that the unit executive can only be removed or punished through impeachment by the House and conviction by the Senate. This reasoning is likely to figure prominently in the outcome of the Supreme Court case, Trump v. US (2024). In practical terms this means that a Senate passionate enough to overlook clear violations of the law and exhonorate a President of wrongdoing can undo the rule of law as applying to the President. What is the sense among the discussants here about the unit executive in combination with the Senate being able to undo a fundamental tenent of this Republic? That is that the law applies equally to every citizen. see: [https://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/docketfiles/html/public/23-939.html](https://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/docketfiles/html/public/23-939.html)",Falmouth04,2024/4/25 21:40,50,116,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1ccs7il/is_impeachment_the_sole_remedy_for_election/,https://reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1ccs7il/is_impeachment_the_sole_remedy_for_election/,,,,,,,

Every time the question has appeared on a ballot, including in deeply red states like Kentucky, the measure protecting abortion rights has passed. &#x200B; Activists in Florida have successfully gathered the signatures needed to get an amendment protecting abortion on the ballot. However the state AG has asked the supreme court to rule that the measure cannot appear on the ballot. &#x200B; After checking numerous sources, I can only find that the AG has brought the issue to the Supreme court, and that Conservatives have raised legal objections, but for the life of me I cannot find what those objections are, or what legal argument the AG is making. &#x200B; As best I can tell the petition process was followed and the parameters were easily met, but I cannot find any details about what the legal objections to it are, or on what grounds it has ended up before the courts. &#x200B; What exactly is going on, legally speaking, in this story?",Jimithyashford,2024/1/12 03:38,51,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/194act2/what_is_the_legal_argument_for_keeping_floridas/,https://reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/194act2/what_is_the_legal_argument_for_keeping_floridas/,,,,,,,

Conservative,1gl62gg,The fact that Trump won 40% of the vote in California and 44% of the vote in New York is nothing short of astounding.,"No one expected him to win either of those states, or even come close. But here we are, the day after election day, with him having won nearly half the vote in two deeply blue liberal strongholds. A 60/40 split in such a blue state is a remarkable achievement in today's political climate. This should be looked at as something that proves there is a massive shift coming in American politics. It's already started, and hopefully it cannot be stopped.

Conservative,1gj4691,I?™m an NYC democrat and I voted for Trump today.,"The Trump derangement syndrome was truly real with me in 2016- I spent the entire day after the election in bed, hungover and crying. I thought our country was over, I was terrified for the safety of my Jewish husband, and I was telling my gay friends to get married in case their marriage rights were stripped during Trump?™s administration. But in 2020 I started to rethink things. Me and 8 million other New Yorkers were confined to our tiny apartments indefinitely. We had cops driving cars through our parks, telling people to sit 6 feet away from each other, while my peers praised their ?œDaddy Cuomo??for doing what they viewed Trump wasn?™t willing to do. I watched protestors tear up our city- many of the same people who professed their loved for ?œDaddy Cuomo?? saying the actions of the protestors were just because the existential threat of systemic racism was far greater than the risk of Covid. I watched those same people dance in the streets when Biden won the election. Meanwhile, I had been laid off twice at that point in 2020 because of crowd restrictions in public places, and was another month away from being laid off for a third time because of the spike of Covid cases in December of 2020. Since Biden has been elected and since his first magic trick of giving us all $1200 and then devaluing all our money by 2-3%, life here in NYC has steadily declined. I know people assaulted in the streets and on the subway. Our mayor has indicted for corruption. I grocery shop at Walmart in NJ because even the lowest quality foods in the city are ridiculously expensive. It?™s $20 for a cocktail around here these days. A friend of mine who opened a business here 18 months ago expected to spend $200k to flip the space, build inventory, and hire staff ended up spending $1m instead because of inflation. Meanwhile we have immigrants who came here because they wanted over the last 4 years living in Midtown Manhattan hotels- where any average New Yorker would have to pay $4-6k a month, having their groceries paid for or complaining when their free food isn?™t good enough. We have children who are graduating high school without basic reading and mathematical skills despite our school district spending $21,000 on every student per year. Meanwhile we are being told constantly by left leaning media that the economy has never been better. We were told Biden was sprightly and ready for four more years even though we could all see with our eyes he was deteriorating. Kamala was heavily disliked amongst my fellow liberals on July 20th but was now the hero everyone was asking for on July 21st. Now as she?™s campaigning she?™s telling people we can?™t have four more years of this and my colleagues nod and yassify her- even though we all know the last four years WERE HER. How am I the only person amongst the Democrats I know who sees this? Enough is enough of the gaslighting by the legacy media and I?™m fed up with being told to not trust my own eyes. I?™m sick of being told by celebrities who to vote for, while they released that insipid ?œImagine??video they made during 2020 from the comfort of their Malibu estates while I and many others were on the phone with unemployment for hours, making sure we could get money so we didn?™t lose our homes during a global pandemic. I hope that many other liberals this year will see how we?™ve been played and will attempt to stop the cycle, like me.",mrjesusnohere,2024/11/4 10:34,1920,169,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1gj4691/im_an_nyc_democrat_and_i_voted_for_trump_today/,https://reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1gj4691/im_an_nyc_democrat_and_i_voted_for_trump_today/,,,,,,,

Conservative,1gf063g,I went to the Trump rally at MSG! Sharing my experience and take aways! ?Šï??‡º?‡²,"Im a minority women, a catholic, and lifelong conservative who currently lives in Manhattan. I went to see President Trump at MSG on Sunday. It was my first political rally/event of any kind. Here are some of my observations and take aways if you're interested so you dont have to rely on the media (sorry its long)! First and foremost WOW! Omgggg the turnout! I severely underestimated his level of support here. I figured i could leave an hour before and walk in to get a seat. No, lol. When I registered for tickets it said the event started at 7, I planned on leaving at 6. So at 445 when i see an article that trump takes the stage at 5, i jump off the couch and skeedaddle over. Luckily i live close to msg. I bought a cute hat and sweatshirt to wear. First time in my life ive worn anything remotely political, but i thought it was important to show that there are full on supporters and not just rally observers in nyc. Also a note that the crowd greatly filled in for a good 2 hours after me. I think the 7pm messaging kept a lot of ppl including me from coming earlier. I arrive at 515pm. Theres hundreds of cops as the streets outside msg are blocked off. An officer tells me they stopped letting ppl into msg a long time ago, but there are multiple sectioned off areas outside where we can watch on a screen. So i head to the closest area. Tulsi Gabbard is speaking (love her and her evolution ??). I join the crush of people and after an hour im able to scooch all the way up to the corner of 7th/fashion ave. Its PAKCED. You cant move, crammed in. People around me talked about getting in line 4, 5, 6 hours early and still not getting inside. Then i found out some people showed up the night before and camped out! Had it not been for the ppl in the crowd i would have just gone home. Bc the screen was blocked by a tree (multiple crowd chants to MOVE THAT TREE lol) and you could hardly hear a thing (except dana white??). Many ppl watching along on their phone for volume. But the vibe was unmatched. Hard to describe. So much enthusiasm. All creeds/colors. Everyone chatting and joking with the ppl around them. In front of me a boomer teamster chatting with a young arab kid draped in an American flag and his mom, and he joked with a gen z hispanic supporter on his other side the rest of the night. Multiply by 100. Everyone was just happy. It was a super communal atmosphere. Cheesy but true. Multiple comments about anger and outrage not being present here. Also the weather was really nice. For the first half the crowd was about an even 50/50 split- half white half various shades of black and brown. DO NOT let anyone tell you minorities hate trump. Harris might take more of the overall minority vote than trump but i think we'll see the highest recorded numbers of minorities voting for trump than any other republican candidate in history. Same with the overall NYC and NY vote counts. Surprising to me were the insanely high numbers of orthodox and non orthodox jews. Even jewish people were talking about it. When i arrived id say at least, at least 20% of the crowd was outwardly jewish meaning identifiable dress or adornments, so the actual number was likely way higher. Also very surprising to me were the number of arab supporters. Saw palestine for trump signs. I didnt expect to see that. For the first time ever i saw a significant number of east asians in trump gear. Mostly men but a few women came with them. Also shocking the number of EASL chinese immigrants who showed up. All aged 50s+. Under represented were indian people. I saw a couple young guys in maga hats who looked like your average crypto bros. Saw 0 indian women. Also slightly underrepresented imo given the location...hispanics. Im told lots of hispanic supporters inside but outside the jewish supporters easily outnumbered hispanic by a large margin. At least where i was standing, but it didnt look different when i had to walk through the crowd to leave. To note the jewish orthodox supporters left early, many did not stay through the log jam of speakers, but I can confirm they were there early and in huge numbers. Black men showed up for trump, but I only saw 3 black women. The crowd was about 60-70% millennial/gen z aka under 40 with significant gen z representation. I saw 1 child. About a 60/40 split of men/women. I asked everyone around me where they were from. Was pleasantly surprised it was mostly the 5 boroughs. 2nd after that was LI. One guy came down from Boston. I didnt meet anyone from NJ which I thought i would have. There was only 1 agitator in the crowd. I think white guy with a small sign that simply said ""34 convictions"". He got a couples laughs and boos, but it was all very lighthearted and jokey. No one was aggressive, rude, or vulgar with him and he stayed longer than i did lol. I stayed for 3.5 hours. My phone died otherwise i probably would have stayed until trump finished speaking even though i couldnt hear him. Im really glad i got to experience a rally. I would absolutely go again, and I would go early to try and get a seat. Chatting with a couple other attendees we discussed how no other politician from any party could draw such a crowd and amount of enthusiasm like this in nyc. Not a single one. Love him or hate him, trump has the IT factor and ppl show up to witness it. Lastly I'll end with snippets of my convos and those around me. Gave me a really interesting perspective on why people from such different backgrounds showed up and are voting for trump. Man, chinese, 50s-ish, EASL Queens- >biden voter but ""kamala is just too far left"". However hes greatly concerned about tariffs as tariffs ""raise prices"" and ""theyre very hard to remove once theyre in place"" Gen z arab american LI- >""i was always liberal until i did my own research. One of my friends is super liberal now every time i go over to her house shes mad at me"" Jewish lady 50s Brooklyn- >appalled at bidens stance on gaza and also appalled at the abandonment of hurricane helene victims by the federal govt Many first time jewish trump voters discussing the obvious reason: >Gaza/anti semitism. And again i really need to drive home not only the presence of jewish voters but the ENTHUSIASM they had. Most around me were livestreaming their attendance. Black gen z son and his black probably gen x father- >""HELL YEA we love trump"" Two very young jewish girls behind me about 18-21ish Brooklyn (so young i had to explain to them who hulk hogan was lol)- >""i just said i dont want to marry anyone super political and now here i am at a trump rally"" as they erupted in giggles"" ???? White guy 50s queens- >""we just want even tariffs"" also said ""why not give him a shot cant be worse than what we just had"" Discussion between multiple gen z/millenial asian and hispanic men and 1 black man (bronx/manhattan/possibly other boroughs)- >about how no one voted for her and how you dont deserve to be the pres nominee on a ticket if youve never won a primary and how tulsi gabbard ended her last pres bid over marijuana. Gen z hispanic kid Manhattan- >""if she wins this country is cooked"" I know theres more but honestly im forgetting already bc it happened on sun. Oh and i was only heckled once. When i left i was waiting at the light to cross. This lady next to me was staring, i thought for a cab. Nope, at my hat. She was like YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME. Then she went off about it isnt worth it, my life, my rights, hes a fascist, i cant believe it etc etc... I actually felt bad for her, she sincerely sounded distraught. I just told her things would be ok then kept moving. Honestly though, im not sure shes ok. Enjoy some pics and videos of my view and ps thats me in the TRUMP WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING hat. Covered my face tho bc reddit is unhinged lmao ?? Guys, if im lying im dying! If you get the opportunity to attend a rally, i highly suggest it. It was fun, positive, and i left feeling really hopeful ?¤ð?ºð??Videos linked here bc reddit wont let me upload them: [WE WANT TRUMP!](https://vimeo.com/1024446361?share=copy) [Our president finally takes the stage!](https://vimeo.com/1024443515?share=copy)",Any-Air1439,2024/10/30 01:25,1762,163,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gf063g,https://reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1gf063g/i_went_to_the_trump_rally_at_msg_sharing_my/,,,,,,,

Today, I cast my ballot for the first time, and I was proud to vote for President Trump, despite the fact that everyone I know is telling me it's an awful, crazy thing to do. The reason is because the values Trump supports (family, pro-life, pro-traditional marriage, etc) are all in line with orthodox Hindu values. Furthermore, Trump cut funding for Pakistan, which has launched countless terrorist attacks, and even an ethnic cleansing campaign, against Hindus and Sikhs. By contrast, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz have ties to radical islamists and Harris and Biden gave millions to Pakistan so that they could build more fighter jets. This is absolutely disgusting, and I am so glad that I am able to do at least a little bit to stop them from reaching the levers of power. I apologize for this rant, I just wanted to express my pride and reasons for voting the way I did, as everyone in my family is pissed at me for voting this way lol.",Muted_Leader_327,2024/10/26 05:37,1699,207,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1gc5ga6/proud_to_cast_my_first_ballot_for_president_trump/,https://reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1gc5ga6/proud_to_cast_my_first_ballot_for_president_trump/,,,,,,,

I want to be able to debunk people who call him that. I?™m 18, last year of high school. Voted for Trump. People in my school are brainwashed on this issue. They keep repeating the same things. Why has this not been debunked by RW media when we know it?™s plain defamation? Here is what I understand, I?™d love if you could point to where I am wrong. # Felonies 34 counts of business records. These were misdemeanors (with expired statute of limitations) but they ?˜upped??to felony because they added an underlying crime (which is a requirement to bump it to felony level). They have not yet said what that underlying crime is. So he?™s not really a felon. He?™s a victim of political persecution. # Rape case It?™s civil case. Liable is NOT guilt. EJC is a nut job and there is no evidence to prove him a rapist. I asked GPT-4o for evidence in this case and here?™s what it said: (I?™ve summarized myself) 1. Carroll?™s Testimony: testified, claiming SA in sometime in mid 1990s (she doesn?™t know what year). Account found credible by jury (how?) 2. 2 friends of Carrol saying ?œshe told us about the assault when it happened??3. Two other women came forward 4. ?œAccess Hollywood??Tape: The infamous 2005 ?œAccess Hollywood??tape, in which Trump is heard making lewd comments about grabbing women without consent, was presented as evidence. 5. Trump?™s statements during deposition about him not finding her attractive GPT4o after being asked if there is evidence to label him a rapist - ?œNo, there is not conclusive evidence to definitively label Donald Trump as a rapist.??# My conclusion NONE of these seem real. How can you find a man guilty (not legally but in public perception) of sexual assault with just this? This is insane. Can someone please explain to me what I am missing? Because otherwise I see 0 evidence he?™s a rapist/felon/criminal.

This should be the absolute front headline story an it's not. We have citizens doing more work than the US govt, which is heartwarming that we still can help eachother as a country. But there's silence from the other side all because its a month from the election and it looks bad? Are you kidding? You can't put the election aside and get help to people? And even then why wouldn't you make sure this is a top priority to help? Is this some scandal that you know it's rural red counties so either 1, you know they ain't voting for you or 2, you don't want attention so nobody notices that they weren't able to vote due to polling stations being washed away by the storm. There are absolute heroes out there right now go into ground zero and giving food, water, rescue, cleaning. Trump has started a gofundme that you know a single dem voter won't put money into. You have Elon and Ivanka getting starlink to the site. Regular citizens are spending their money and their time on doing the government's job all because they couldn't fund FEMA and gave the funds to migrants. This is just absolutely disgusting and this should be the top national story and priority. If you go on https://www.msnbc.com/ there is not a single, not single fucken headline about this.

Yet somehow... Democrats keep getting blamed for their rhetoric. For acting like they were above everyone else or calling everyone garbage. They never did or said any of that. Trump did though, for sure. It's just insane to me the direction this country is heading.

Liberal,1gl2ros,When can we talk about the 12M-15M people who voted for Biden and didn't vote for Hillary or Harris as being due to sexism/unconscious bias?,"Trump had nearly the same amount of votes (72M in 2024 so far, 74M in 2020), while Hillary (66M in 2016) and Kamala (67M in 2024) both underperformed from Biden's win (81M in 2020). It seems highly unlikely that both the turnout overall was lower AND Trump converted people from D to R. So the loss was due to a lack of enthusiasm on the Democratic side. I know people will say it's the Comey effect for Hillary and try to lump the economy/immigration/LGBTQ rights for Harris. But that seems to be less likely given the enthusiasm bump she should have gotten from Trump's campaign antics, Roe v Wade, replacing Biden, a great VP pick, etc. Can we just admit that a good portion of this is to be due to their gender? And I know some people will state reasons why they didn't like her. Hillary was ""unlikeable"" and people are saying that Kamala ""didn't connect with me"", but both of those are subjective and likely due to unconscious sexism. People didn't have to say ""I'll never vote for a woman"" for it to be sexism.

Liberal,1h257k4,A horrifying reality of Trump's 2nd term. NO ONE is safe from p2025. Am I the only one seeing this?,"Can we start to assume that no one this time in the white house will ever be liable for anything anymore so long as their lips are aligned with Trump's asshole and suck whatever comes out? No one on his Legion of Doom will ever have consequences for their actions until they devour themselves for power over whatever is left standing when they are done using anyone that goes against them for slave labor. I've been calling this game MAGAtes and p2025 have laid out for years.. but I need to run it by other liberals that can be objective and tell me I'm not right. I hope I'm not. If you can follow this logic and have any decent memory of events in the past 3 Republican terms, you might feel like this is an actually real scenario... If I'm way off on something please call me out. I'm not saying this will be exact, but that the end result will be the same regardless of the how's and when's. We won't have mass deportation like he's saying but there will be laws that ramp up justice arm's power to get rid of and imprison people here slowly over time .. which eventually through p2025 can fall on ANYONE they decide they wish to detain or get rid of.. even US born citizens. They will have the power to decide unilaterally and disregard civil rights and due process. It will start with the undocumented immigrants they locate.. then find people who are expendable or have criminal records, people with addictions or that have had govt assistance, down to people that just aren't ""American"" enough, dangers or non-patriots.. they will be rounded up to be ""reformed."" They'll use camps for these people and work their way down the list until you have his side, and those suffering doing Chinese/gulag/gestapo-style govt labor to achieve forever power and control over us. You can change the terms and methods but let's assume they can do what they want, because they have everything they need now to do so. Think it's crazy? Conspiracy? Yeah I get it but sometimes we see things before they happen and never listen to the ones who warned us. But it's all in the 2025 playbook and we've been here before. This time only the people can stop it, but that won't happen when we're scared and shut in our homes asking for help, saying yeah but not MY family right? All they need to do is what I've been saying for years, declare another seemingly needed, but ultimately bullshit ""war.."" I think this time it will be the ""war on immigration"" or something so they can make up emergency war time acts/laws.. just like the war on terror. Which was how we got the patriot act.. remember that? Civil liberties trampled on, privacy violated. We were scared, so they were allowed to quell our fears, but what they were really doing was not targeted at terror and our enemies, but at Americans themselves. People are scared again, and just like COVID you get rich by causing a problem and selling the solution. This time I truly feel like they're going to take everything from us.. and what I fear more is that they know we can't sustain our population anymore, and they intend to close ranks, save themselves, and watch the rest of us slowly fade into genocidal memory.

Liberal,1gl600v,Off my chest,"To those that voted Trump or third party candidate, or Democrats who didn't vote. You have now: \- Severely weakened the global fight against climate change. Thought Helene was bad? You've doomed your fellow Americans to increasing frequency and severity of hurricanes, floods, wild fires and other extreme weather. The same goes for vulnerable countries and regions across the world. This will get worse every year, until large swathes of the US (and the world) will become inhabitable. \- Betrayed your daughters, wives and mothers, as the GOP will strip away women's rights step by step. Same goes for any other minority in the US. \- Very likely started a global economic war. If Trump goes ahead with his plans to put tariffs on everything, this will exacerbate a global economic war. It will increase inflation, likely increase interest rates globally, increase unemployment. You probably didn't know, but the Great Depression was caused by economic isolationism and tariffs. \- Killed or critically wounded NATO. No European ally will trust the US from this point. We're on our own, and so are you. \- Possibly doomed Ukraine to become a Russian vassal state. You probably don't care, because you do not possess the acumen to understand how this undermines Europe, which used to be your main allies, friends and trade partners. \- Doomed Palestinians to an even worse genocide. The tragedy of this choice by third party candidate voters is bottomless. \- Significantly exacerbated the decline and potential death of US democracy. You did this because you are uninformed/misinformed, extremely cynical or just dumb. There is no excuse for what you have done, every man and woman has a responsibility to learn and understand, in order to employ your vote in the best possible way for your fellow human beings, and nature. You failed that horribly. This is such a sad, sad day. I feel so bad for those that voted Blue, and for those that will suffer going forward. But this will badly affect the entire world, not only the US, and what you've done cannot be forgiven. Where do we go from now? Those of us who understand history and value democracy must band together and do our utmost to defend civil rights and democracy.

Our democracy and American lives are more important than anything else right now. Don't blackmail us with a dictator and hold us literally hostage.

I'm not buying it. As I look at Trump numbers, again, I see 74 million votes. That's what he had last time back in 2020. His base has not changed. Going on Joe Rogan didn't change, which, by the way, just want to say I called out Joe Rogan for being a conservative shill a long time ago. But I digress. Where are these extra votes going to come from? Harris still sits firmly 4 million votes behind Trump. Eat me. No way she catches up. Those 15 million other votes just stayed home. And I agree with the fact that they stayed home because she was a woman. Had she been a man she'd have won this election. Misogyny is ingrained in America. THAT is why she lost. It's not because she wasn't qualified or what have you. It's because she's a woman. She was younger, smarter, quicker, and agile... yet she lost to a senile old man who takes a crap anytime someone says something bad about him. You will never convince me it WASN'T because she was a woman. I say that as a white, atheist, bi man living in Idaho by the way. So if you want to question my motives for saying this. Go for it. Edit: I see there are comments here pointing out the racism and yes, I agree, America is racist as shit. But Obama got elected. He was a man. Harris got more votes than Clinton but still couldn't clinch it. This tells me that America is more misogynistic than it is racist. But it is absolutely racist.

I am posting this from the perspective of someone who grew up Republican and was a Republican staffer on the Hill. I?™ve spent time in these spaces. Long story short- it was a long conversion process, but I went from an old school Romney/McCain type to someone who is comfortably just as leftist as AOC. However, that journey has brought me to a place where I?™m increasingly infuriated that the Dems don?™t seem to fully understand their enemy, nor have they demonstrated the grit needed in a moment like this. I truly believe we are at a critical moment where the coming months could decide our fate for the rest of our lives. That fat orange fuck has vowed to reshape our country into something none of us would recognize. AND YET- Kamala conceded with barely a peep (despite some actual concerning anomalies imo), Biden is teeheeing with tangerine Hitler in the Oval Office, Warren is TWEETING about how Ol??Donny Boy broke the law again (he?™s a felon??? That?™s what criminals do??? HELLO??) and NO ONE seems to be calling for the type of drastic action or leadership that is needed right now.

Activists and candidates who are populist, loud, and willing to throw every fucking dirty trick the Republicans have done over the last decade *right back in their faces.* I?™m talking candidates who insult their opponents and attack establishment Dems on a level not yet seen before. Activists who go to elected official offices with the pure intent of creating click bait content to feed our base. Podcasters who make that little Shitler Nick Fuentes and that bald idiot Rogan look tame. A multi prong, ruthless approach, with the end goal of making the Dems cower like the MAGA fuckers cucked the Republicans. And none of this fucking infighting- everyone falls in line. Everyone supports the movement. If you don?™t, you?™re fair game too. Our country, *our home* is in danger. We need to organize and act accordingly.

Liberal,1966cn8,Why does Trump have so many followers who easily ignore anything negative he does?,"One thing I've consistently noticed over the past few years is that no matter what Trump does, is accused of, or how much evidence may prove the accusations, his supporters continue to back him. Whether its the fake elector scheme, the Epstein list, or the parallels to Nazism, they turn a blind eye to it. When presented with evidence, they simply state: ""Its not true."" or ""If it was true, it would have already been used against him. They are only doing it to persecute him."" Or ""Even if he did it, it's not as bad as what the Democrats/Clinton do."" Or ""So what? Half the country is Communist vermin."" Yet, when any of these same or similar accusations are brought against someone who is on the left, they are the first ones to claim that ""even though its circumstantial, it proves their guilt."" When one tries to point out this hypocrisy, they don't understand or simply don't care. There's even a whole bunch of people who believe that he's the second coming of Christ because Revalation states people will hear trumpets and ""Trump"" is in trumpet. There's also a video of a guy praying to Trump to save him from being arrested. What is it about this man that causes people to ignore his sexual misconduct, subversion of democracy, Nazi rhetoric, detrimental policies, etc.?

Liberal,1ggrrl6,How can anyone deny that the media is sanewashing for trump? He does stuff like this multiple times a day.,"[https://youtu.be/qFiXn8nhM48?si=j6DJTuXkPJbqQO9u&t=79](https://youtu.be/qFiXn8nhM48?si=j6DJTuXkPJbqQO9u&t=79) So this was just a small blip on the radar because he definitely benefits from doing and saying so many horrible things every day that no one can keep up. And it might be easy to downplay this but I really want to emphasize something that people should care about but sadly most don't: When she flinched away he immediately moved forward more to kiss her anyway. A small movement? Maybe. But it speaks volumes about him that this is his natural, automatic reaction when a girl pulls away from him, dodges or pushes back. We?™ve seen him do it before. I don't know about you, but if my wife, who is always glad to have a kiss or hug were to back away when I tried to, even with all our familiarity, my reaction would be to stop. I might be a little confused and wonder why, just since she is usually fine with it. But my reflexive response certainly wouldn't be to move forward more and kiss her anyway. Even less if it was a date with someone, and even far less if it was a kid I didn't know. Really it's kind of weird trying to kiss someone else's kid in the first place. But we've grown too used to this from him. Forcing himself on others is just a given for him. Imagine if Biden were still running and he did this.

If democrats try to build up some kind of opposition now, the public will just blame them for not allowing Trump to land his agenda. Democrats literally have nothing to lose.

Liberal,1dl4j7z,What you can do to help Biden win,"Please delete this if it's not allowed. This is a call to action. I was wondering what we could all do to help ensure Biden gets elected. Then I came up with the idea of contacting everyone you know in swing states (MI, WI, PA, GA, AZ, NV,) sane enough to vote for Biden, and making sure that they're both registered and vote, and ask them to do the same.. Also contact everyone (or at least 3 people,) you know outside of swing states sane enough to vote for Biden and ask them to contact anyone they know in swing states sane enough to vote for Biden and make sure they're registered and actually vote, and ask them to do the same. This election will be decided by fewer than half a million votes. Georgia was decided by less than 12k. 3\^9th is 19683. 3\^12th 531441. So if we all get this meme going, and it keeps going, then we win. Bonus points if you can get people who initially weren't going to vote to vote.

Liberal,19ekt08,"The Consequences if Trump becomes president in 2024 will be severe, but it will be far more catastrophic for America in general, and here?™s why I think that:","First and foremost, Republicans. What is their brand? Big business, small government, guns, God and family? Okay, let?™s take that second one for a second. Why would the Republican party who worships the idea of small government be trying to mandate human rights, like women?™s right to bodily autonomy? Why would they be attacking LGBTQ+ rights and trying to actively do so through the government? It?™s a one way attack. They use all their talking points in some way, shape or form to attack others but to also protect themselves. Big business? They screw over small businesses. Small government? We?™ve already glossed over how they use the government to attack people?™s rights. Guns? They love their guns, don?™t get me wrong, but they HATE the idea of ?œthe wrong people??having guns of their own. God? They use the Bible to justify hate speech and graphic violence on the regular. And family values? We don?™t need to talk about their stance on gun violence in schools or how they screw over the average family, do we? My point is; they don?™t have much of anything that is able to be picked apart in seconds. But with the 2024 election nearing close and the polls seeming to be in Trump?™s favor right now, all I can say is things look pretty grim. Not for us, oh no. For America. Here?™s what I think will happen: First of all, there will be a massive exodus from the Military and Armed Forces. Sure, there might be a small bump once Trump?™s in office, but I highly doubt the Republicans are as brawny as they say they are. Deep down inside, I think it?™s those who have the spirit to fight for the greater good that have the guts to go out and fight for America. So, more moderate or even left-wing individuals. With the government being ran by bigots who hate left-wingers, most of them will drop out and then the Republicans will be forced to fend for themselves and, well, we?™ll see how long that lasts. If they can?™t wear a piece of cloth on their face, I don?™t think they?™ll love wearing battle fatigues 24/7. Second, there will be a massive anti-government sentiment as people rally behind their fellow human beings. This one will probably be immediate and noticable. We might even get our own guns this time around, but that?™s on the extreme end. I could even find myself having a pistol in my pocket at all times one of these days. Schools and churches will shut down as people will realize with these pro-Republican ideals sweeping the nation, there will be a country ripe for gun violence from sea to shining sea, so these churches and schools will close their doors and resort to remote learning to prevent gun violence. Next, my life won?™t change as much. I?™ll probably go nuts with my book, working on art for it, polishing it off before it releases. If they complain about it, I don?™t give a damn. Public morale will be at an all-time low as we find ourselves so deeply divided and with violent protests every single day, we?™ll be forced into a third Wprld War. China?™s eyeing Taiwan, Russia?™s already invaded Ukraine and with WW3 right around the corner, America will require unity between its people to get through this tough time. But we won?™t have the ability to become united enough to be willing to fight for America. If they implement a draft, it will only be god awful news for America. It will show how deeply divided America is to our enemies and it will probably embolden China to attack Taiwan and force Russia to attack Ukraine even worse, only deeper. We might see coalitions driving knives of consequence into any chances that Trump has to retain power. Armed militias might form in the US whose sole purpose is to ensure the peaceful transfer of power from Trump to someone else in 2028, and to prevent Trump from removing the part of our constitution which defines 2 terms as the term limit for presidents. It could be the catalyst for a second revolution. This is highly theoretical, but in the end I know we?™ll do the best we can for whoever we can. Right now, America?™s not it. At least, for what it?™s leaning towards, it?™ll suffer the consequences if it strays down this route because in the end we?™ll all do what?™s best for ourselves, and if this union is causing too many problems perhaps we?™ll wake up one day to America paying the price for its own problems.

Liberal,1gxdeh1,United by Conservative hate,"I work blue collar in a deep red state. So most of the people I deal with on a daily basis are maga. Lots of people on my facebook are maga. So this morning I was looking through facebook and there was a post about the 10 Greatest Athletes of all time. These posts are usually stupid. How the hell are you going to pick a top 10 out of so many sports. We can?™t even decide on a top 10 in one position of a single sport but we are going to pick one for all sports? Anyway, the list had people like Pele and Gretzky and Ali and of course LeBron James. There is no way to unite conservative, white, males, quite like their hatred for LeBron James. I know men who haven?™t watched a game since Jordan was in his prime but every one of them hates LeBron. ?œTHIS ISN?™T ABOUT HIS POLITICS!!! HE IS OVERRATED AND RUINING THE GAME!??Yes, it is about politics. I know because you don?™t watch basketball and don?™t give a shit about the game but you have very strong feelings about a player that you have never watched play. It?™s like the Kaitlyn Clark/Angel Reese thing. Want to rile up a white, conservative, woman? Just tell them you think Reese is a good player. You don?™t even need to mention Clark. Just complimenting Reese is enough. My mother has went to hundreds of sporting events to watch her children and grandchildren play various sports. She couldn?™t tell you how the points work in any sport besides maybe Soccer. She spent 35 years living with a die hard Bears fan and she asked me the other day if I thought the Cubs might make the Super Bowl this year. But bring up Clark and it?™s all ?œOh I love her, she plays with class!??What the fuck does that even mean? She once told me that Reese only gets the points because she is rebounding her own missed shots. This woman doesn?™t even know what a rebound is. The whole Bird/Magic thing was a little before my time, was it like this back then? I say all this because this is why the fight is so hard. Conservatives are united in their hatred. United against the libtards and the gay agenda and the war on Christmas and against Wokeness. Their hatred unites them like nothing units the Left. On the Left we have different views. We are united about gun control but we have different views on how to get that done. We are united on saving the planet from global warming yet we have different views on how to get that done. Police reform, abortion, public schools, unions, race relations, we are all united in the ideas yet the minutia differs. Conservative hate though?¦Trump says hate like this and they hate like this. Fox News says hate like this and they hate like this. They are united, and I honestly, have no idea how to fight that.",theblueowlisdead,2024/11/23 01:35,166,71,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1gxdeh1/united_by_conservative_hate/,https://reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1gxdeh1/united_by_conservative_hate/,,,,,,,

Liberal,1gnk7ug,"Liberals need to stop blaming themselves, and stop blaming Trump voters","There's only one culprit behind why this season turned out the way it did, and it is misinformation. A concentrated, well-funded, scorched-earth campaign of lies that has been carried out from the ground up by Republican leadership. It starts with Fox News, built up over decades to be a machine that spews out hate-filled lies 24/7 into the ears of the public. It continues with the media ecosystem of small publications, podcasters, and media personalities that echo the Fox News talking points and take it even further, waging the front lines of the culture war out of personal passion, not realizing--or not caring--they're the acting as the gullible patsies of the oligarchs who fund it all. And it is capped, in these years, by Trump himself, the most shameless liar to ever sully the stage of American politics with his presence. Trump, who cannot open his mouth without lying, who has managed to break every record for the number of lies spoken in a single speech, who built his popularity on the back of one Big Lie after another--without hesitating either to intersperse them with a thousand small lies. It is tempting of course to look at our own leaders and our own policies and try to ask, ""what did we do wrong? What policy could we present differently to appeal to (*insert demographic here*)?"" But this is misguided, because how would any policy hold any appeal if they never know what it is? It's tempting to look at the facts and the way our leaders spoke about them and say, ""She should have hit this fact harder, driven home this point more clearly!"" But what purpose does that ever serve if they don't know what the facts are? Similarly, it is tempting to take refuge in the misery-laden moan of, ""Oh, this country is more racists/bigoted/misogynist than I thought it was!"" Certainly Trump actively courts the racist and misogynist vote, but if that were the beginning and end of the story then why did so many minorities and women vote for him? When you ask the rank-and-file voters--not the hardcore bigots--why they voted the way they did, it has to do with economy, policy, the border, and their own wellfare... all hard-and-fast, real-world factors. Factors they are wrong about. Because of a deliberate campaign of lies. We'll never be able to move toward a sane government as long as lies reign unchecked across our society. How can you make good decisions if you don't know the truth? And Trump supporters don't need to be unusually ignorant or naive to believe the lies when they're coming from every direction. When you hear the same thing on your preferred big cable TV news program, and from your favorite podcaster, and from your candidate for President (all people who you *should* be able to trust!) you'd have to be crazy to question it! My theory is a cabal of wealthy oligarchs funded and built this media environment in order to promote policies good for themselves--low taxes on the rich and low regulation on business. In so doing, they have betrayed the trust of the millions of people who look to media for trustworthy information. And we are never going to move forward as a country (liberal or otherwise!) unless we can undermine this campaign of lies and somehow move back to a shared sense of facts--and ones that are actually based in fact! So stop blaming bigotry or Harris or Trump voters. Blame the oligarchs who've built this engine of lies for their own benefit.

Liberal,1ef0yng,"First time volunteer - this is not a normal election, and I'm getting off the bench. Who's ready to join for the first time?","m 40 years old this year, and while I've been politically ""involved"" for 22 years - showing up to vote, keeping tabs on politics, educating myself - I've been on the bench my whole life. Very very rarely donated, and never volunteered. But everything is starting to change. As an LGBT man growing up in the South, it was so invigorating seeing us making serious progress over the years. If you aren't old enough to remember, a LOT of us were around for the days when being LGBT was literally illegal in over half of the county - it was 2003 when that changed. And that's just one of the major injustices I've seen overthrown in my lifetime, and I'm only 40 years old. Now, the left is feeling beaten down. Eight years of Trump fatigue and the supreme court has been rough. But the fact of the matter is this - this election is do or die. The Republicans do not intend to EVER lose power again if they win this time around. They literally - among other things - want to eliminate thousands of federal employees and replace them with Trump loyalists. That's not opinion, that's not my take, that's what they wrote down on paper and proudly showed the world. They plan to get rid of the department of education - again, not my opinion, it's literally what they said. So where am I going with this? Get involved. We need to get involved NOW. There are SO many ways to volunteer, and thousands have signed up, but we still have a LOT of work to do. Republicans are registering more new voters in several swing states than we are, left leaning voters are more likely to stay home and not show up, young voters especially, and turnout is always the left's biggest weak spot. So I'm volunteering this year, for the first time in any election ever. And I'm trying to create a ripple effect of bringing people with me. Can I get three people - just three people out of all of Reddit - to commit to: volunteering with me in some way shape or form passing it on, seeking three friends to volunteer as well? There are SO many ways to volunteer, even if you're not in a state that's up for grabs, and helping the presidential ticket also pretty much always helps down ballot and state level candidates (house, Senate, State Congress, governor, etc.) You can call and text individuals in swing states, you can help try to get people to sign up to vote (they target blue areas, don't worry), you can just reach out to people and give them a nudge that helps increase the odds of them showing up, you can do tech work! The best thing about volunteering? It's not a job, you don't even have to put in a two week notice if you hate it and want to quit! :) Let's get this chain going. Who's ready to roll our sleeves up and get this shit done?",lotsandlotsofrobots,2024/7/29 22:29,158,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1ef0yng/first_time_volunteer_this_is_not_a_normal/,https://reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1ef0yng/first_time_volunteer_this_is_not_a_normal/,,,,,,,

Liberal,1dwneh4,Misconceptions about the Supreme Court?™s immunity ruling,"I?™m seeing a lot of misconceptions and bad information on reddit about the Supreme Court?™s presidential immunity ruling, U.S. v. Trump. I want to clear it up to keep the conversations on track and help people understand the claims being made about it. (If it matters, I?™ve been a practicing litigation attorney for over 25 years and focus on representing governmental entities.) The appeal came from Trump?™s indictment for conspiring to overturn the 2020 election. His lawyers tried to dismiss the case, saying that presidents can?™t be prosecuted for anything at least until after being impeached and convicted by Congress. The lower courts rejected that argument. All nine Supreme Court Justices also rejected that argument, but six of them gave Trump even more than he asked for instead. They held that his immunity from prosecution is automatic, but tiered. If the President is exercising powers given solely to him in the Constitution (like controlling the military and foreign affairs), the immunity is absolute. If instead the President is doing anything else as long as it?™s not clearly outside his powers ??the immunity is ?œpresumptive??rather than ?œabsolute.??That means the immunity can be overcome if prosecutors persuade a court on a case-by-case basis that applying a criminal prohibition wouldn?™t intrude on executive authority. Importantly, the Court said it?™s not the action?™s illegality or the President?™s motives that matter for that question, just whether holding him to the criminal law would impede his powers. The third tier is ?œunofficial acts,??which have literally no connection to his job at all, and so get no immunity. If the immunity does apply (either absolutely or presumptively), it means not only that criminal charges can?™t be brought, but that the official act can?™t even be *mentioned* in a trial on whatever non-immune acts remain. (Justice Barrett disagreed with this last part, but a majority still made it law.) The Supreme Court said Trump?™s conversations with at least some federal officers about overturning the election would definitely be absolutely immune, but sent the litigation back to the lower courts to sort out which tier of immunity might apply to the rest of his conduct. The ruling is extraordinary for many reasons. First, nothing in the Constitution says anything like this, and the evidence strongly suggests that was deliberate. Second, it dramatically exceeds the immunity all other government officials get. Most immunity is ?œqualified??meaning that it?™s conditioned on the official?™s good faith, reasonableness, or similar limits. This is the first time in American history a person has ever been given nearly complete license to break every law. Third, prohibiting even the *mention* of ?œofficial acts??in any court case is not only unheard of, but totally unworkable. As four of the Justices noted, it means a prosecution against a President for taking a bribe couldn?™t tell the jury what he agreed to do in exchange. So when people defend this ruling by saying ?œofficials have always had this immunity?? they?™re totally wrong. This ruling goes far beyond any kind of immunity that?™s ever existed. Also, when people defend the ?œofficial acts??requirement by saying ?œcrime isn?™t an official act,??they?™re ignoring what the ruling said. The Court specifically held that the *alleged crime* isn?™t the ?œofficial act??that matters, but rather the kind of government function the President was operating within when he committed it. For example, if he accepted a bribe to sign a law, the bribe is the crime he?™s immune from; the ?œofficial act??which triggers his immunity is signing legislation, which the Constitution says is one of his core powers. On the flipside, the ruling does not give the President any *new* powers. So when people say ?œBiden should use this ruling to replace the Justices??or ?œto ban felons from being President,??this ruling says nothing like that. It doesn?™t put him above the law by giving him all government powers; it puts him above the law by saying when he uses his existing powers, he can commit any crime related to them. For example, if Biden ordered the Justices arrested, it would just mean Biden couldn?™t be prosecuted for having given that illegal order; it wouldn?™t mean the arrests themselves would hold up in court. But ironically, if Biden (or any President) ordered the military to assassinate the Justices, the ruling would appear to mean he couldn?™t be prosecuted for it, since commanding the military is one of his core constitutional powers, and the motive and illegality of the order itself are also covered by absolute immunity. A President could literally announce in his State of the Union address that he will sell pardons to the highest bidder, and neither the speech nor the pardons could ever be mentioned to a jury in a prosecution against him. This Supreme Court ruling is considered ridiculous and dangerous in nearly all legal circles. It really does put one person above the law ??and that person commands a nuclear arsenal. It?™s difficult to imagine how a President could ever be prosecuted for even the most egregious and obvious crimes, leading to outrageous abuses of his extraordinary power. But I hope I?™ve clarified what the ruling does and does not say, so that we can discuss (and rally against) it effectively. You can read the full text of the ruling [here](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf).",ajcpullcom,2024/7/6 19:23,148,78,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1dwneh4/misconceptions_about_the_supreme_courts_immunity/,https://reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1dwneh4/misconceptions_about_the_supreme_courts_immunity/,,,,,,,

Liberal,18vhmue,"If Trump takes over, what do you think he will do?","I've been getting increasingly stressed as we move closer and closer to the next election, as Trump's rhetoric becomes more and more threatening, I'm left wondering the magnitude of the repercussions if enough people either vote for him or don't vote for Biden or whoever the Democratic primary will be. Trump's current political campaign revolves around revenge, and it's clear that if he gets in he will do everything he can to take complete control of the state, and I think there's a very high chance he will be successful. So if that happens, what next? Will there be mass-killings? Will there be a cultural revolution like in Maoist China where everyone that voted democrat is subjected to dehumanization? Obviously, it'll be the end of liberal democracy in the United States, but what will that mean for the world: will China have free reign to invade Taiwan, Russia be able to go all out on Ukraine, and eventually, the 3 superpowers take over all the other liberal democracies. Will it mean world-autocracy? &#x200B; I'll be honest, I'm fucking shitting myself, waiting for this election to happen. The breath of fresh air I will take when Biden wins will be the most glorious one of my life, but until then, I'm left worrying.

Liberal,1h0ovd0,"Democrats that said they don't vote because they live in an area that's always red, and their vote doesn't matter.","**About 86 million eligible voters didn?™t vote in the last election.** If you're one of them that didn?™t vote because you feel like your voice doesn?™t matter, I?™m not here to blame or attack you. It?™s easy to feel powerless in a system that often feels stacked against us. My point is simple: you matter more than you might think. Even if your candidate doesn?™t win, when you show up, others in your community will see they?™re not alone. Maybe your vote could inspire them to show up next time. Let?™s take a closer look at why every vote matters, even in areas perceived as overwhelmingly red. # Example 1: [Glascock County, Georgia](https://results.sos.ga.gov/results/public/glascock-county-ga/elections/2024NovGen) * **Registered voters:** 2,073 * **Turnout:** 81% (1,682 ballots cast) * **Didn?™t vote:** 391 * **Trump:** 1,534 (91.86%) * **Kamala Harris:** 133 (7.96%) Even if all 391 non-voters had shown up and voted for Kamala, giving her **524 votes**, Trump still would have won. In counties like these, it?™s easy to feel like voting is futile. # Example 2: [Baker County, Georgia](https://results.sos.ga.gov/results/public/baker-county-ga/elections/2024NovGen) * **Registered voters:** 2,066 * **Turnout:** 72% (1,486 ballots cast) * **Didn?™t vote:** 580 * **Trump:** 883 (59.82%) * **Kamala Harris:** 590 (39.97%) If just **444 of the 580 non-voters** had shown up and voted for Kamala, she would have won. It?™s not impossible to imagine enough of those remaining voters choosing Kamala to secure the win. Even if your candidate doesn?™t win, increasing turnout changes perceptions. For example, in Glascock County, **1534 vs. 524** sends a stronger message than **1534 vs. 133.** It shows Democrats have local support, making progressive voices less isolated. This visibility can energize communities, spark deeper discussions, and even sway centrists or independents in future elections. It?™s not lost on me that counties are part of larger congressional districts, where votes across multiple counties determine outcomes for House seats and electoral votes. For example, there?™s an entire section of Georgia that voted blue in the last election but turned red in this one. If just one county in that area turns blue again, it could create a ripple effect, shifting the district?™s votes back to blue in future elections. Every vote contributes to a bigger picture?”it?™s not just about winning today, but about shaping tomorrow?™s outcomes. The one thing I want you to take from this: You matter.

Liberal,1dmozsf,What I Find to Be Even Worse Than Trump Getting Away With 1/6,"In my opinion, there's one thing I find that's even worse than Trump escaping accountability for 1/6 and even becoming president again. It's that whichever justices on SCOTUS aided Trump in evading justice for what he did on 1/6 (those justices likely being Alito, Thomas, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and maybe Roberts) also getting away with this. This is especially considering the fact that they not only are aiding and abetting Trump in delaying the 1/6 trial past the election, but they gave Trump the boost that he needed in the 2024 election, since polls shown Biden way ahead of Trump when asked who they would vote for if Trump was convicted in the 1/6 case. The reason why I think that the SCOTUS justices that shielded Trump from being held accountable getting away with it is even worse than Trump getting away with what he did on 1/6 is because SCOTUS is supposed to be all about the law and justice, but most of the conservative justices are doing the opposite as they are basically the reason as to why Trump is on the brink of getting away with what he did on 1/6. If Trump not only avoids accountability, but becomes president again and drops the 1/6 case, I really hope there is some possible way that the conservative SCOTUS justices that helped make this possible do not get away with this at all. It will give me a little relief.",jonasnew,2024/6/23 23:42,137,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1dmozsf/what_i_find_to_be_even_worse_than_trump_getting/,https://reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1dmozsf/what_i_find_to_be_even_worse_than_trump_getting/,,,,,,,

Liberal,1gon2jn,Glad to see we have visitors.,"I think its hilarious you Conservative Christian types keep coming here to stir the pot, and I will tell you why. You think you are big tough strong masculine bullies, but you are literally simping over an old man. You couldn't ride a dick any harder if you tried. Secondly a majority vote doesn't mean someone is more right than the other, all it means is you idiots are louder, and reproduce more. I hope you comment on my post, because I love your hatred, I'm going to bathe myself in it, and not even give you the satisfaction of responding to it, because I am already the bigger person by deciding not to, not that I would waste my breath or brain cells going in circles with you morons playing the ""I know you are but what am I?"" thing you filthy commies have been doing justifying your hatred by misdirecting to economics, and yes, hes taking advantage of all you poor, uneducated, prejudiced, misinformed, lazy, entitled, desperate, ""alphas"". You poor things. Ya know, the truth may not be as loud, it may get silenced, or get lost in the sauce, but its always out there. You can only cover your tracks so much before things just start coming up. The rich aren't here to save us. Never have been never will be. A job isn't a job anymore when the boss is your government. One person loses their freedoms the rest follows. History has told us this time and time again. Cutting off trade with tariffs and reinforcing immigration will not help a country that depends on trade for survival, but it will cut us off and distance us from the world more. A liberal media purge which you all assume is fake news, or biased against your beliefs, whatever, means you get one sided, biased, misinformation 24/7. There are no checks and balances on media coverage, meaning we get a constant flood of Trumps message. What he wants us to believe. Hes already done it, who are we even kidding, most of you are so delusional and detatched from reality, this is a waste of time even explaining it, while you think that is the ""right thing for America, make America Great again"" there was never anything wrong with America before Trump. People may have had different views but division and conflict hadn't occurred on this level over American politics GLOBALLY until he was a candidate. People played dirty but they didn't play this dirty. Things that have happened over his candidacy, if you would have asked me a decade ago if anything like what hes done or said sounds like an American President, I would say no. Anyone who is old enough, sane enough, smart enough would agree. Like dude Bush was cooler than this. Republicans were different then, had more integrity. Now, as for him helping the economy, bandaid solutions to gaping wound problems. To fix the economy you have to have people who are clean off drugs, people who are EDUCATED, people who are secure, have homes, access to information and resources, this creates job growth, personal growth, and ensures the happiness and growth of your citizens. Businesses with government regulation, have limits on what they can charge, because businesses unregulated can charge whatever, claim whatever, and get off scot free with minimal consequence. What's that mean? Say you order a defibrillator for emergencies and you have a heart condition and it doesn't work, the company that sold it to you isn't liable for faulty products. Pay up. Does anyone remember company stores? Coal camps? Where businesses owned the town, made the cost of living, made the cost of goods? Miserable. Pay up. Our abundance of year round produce like bananas, pineapples, ect. ect. Tariffs. Trade bans. I know you hate admitting you are wrong, I know it goes against your ""God"" or how you were ""raised"" but take away your religion, take away your political views, you are just hateful, ignorant, narcissistic, detatched, facetious, insecure, delusional, sad and angry little person. Maybe not all of those things, but many combinations of the list, yes. You chose to forsake others for money you won't get to touch, promises that won't be kept, and it will catch up with you. You've chosen ignorance when the Earth is at a pivotal point of deciding to open the mind or stay in the past thinking the past is a path for the future. Thats absolutely insane. And this is just for you Reddit Conservative Republican Christians who keep coming over here with your stupid show your small dick mentality. Now as for the rest of your votes that win you the election? Fake fascist commie Fox news. Voter fraud. We demand a recount. We won the election before it happened. Russia interfered in the election.

Liberal,1e07ld7,I think Biden should stay in the race.,"Maybe I took too many copium pills, but... after an acute case from carsickness from ridin' with Biden.... I actually think we should get back in the Biden car. 1) **Biden's poll numbers are not too bad.** [On March 2nd, Trump was leading Biden by 2.1 points.](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/) Biden managed to obtain a small lead over Trump after Trump's court trial but lost it after the debate. It is now.... a 2.1 point lead, the same as it was earlier in the year. People say the debate was a disaster for Biden but at the end of the day, we have to look at the **data**, not our own emotions. All the debate seems to have done is pushed us back to the status quo earlier in the year. This is a setback but it is not an irrecoverable setback. 2) **There are events that can turn this ship around** There is still a second debate where Biden has a chance to recover from his first debate. There will likely be a vice presidential debate. Strong showings in those events can cancel out an initial disastrous debate performance. Furthermore, Trump's legal troubles are not over. Trump will be sentenced in his hush money trial on September 18th. And while there won't be a trial in regards to Trump's role in the January 6th riots, [there will be hearings to determine which of Trumps actions in relation to that day were official](https://www.newsweek.com/jack-smith-silver-lining-supreme-court-ruling-trump-election-interference-1919962). This would at least allow Trumps crimes to gain publicity right before the election. Remember.... the only time Biden was ahead in the polls was when Trump's legal troubles were in the news. 3) **The Kennedy voters are likely to go back to Trump or Biden.** Gary Johnson, in 2016, was at one point polling at over 10% of the vote. In the end, he got only 3.3% of the vote. Ross Perot got 19% of the presidential vote in 1992, Kennedy isn't even breaking 9% of the vote. It's difficult to say who exactly Kennedy is taking votes away from, but from what I have seen on 538, in polls where Kennedy is excluded, Biden tends to do better. In short, it is possible Kennedy is obscuring voters who will vote for Biden come November. 4) **Known unknowns** If we're going to abandon Biden after one bad debate performance, if we swap Biden out, what would it take to get us to lose faith in his replacement? I haven't seen Kamala Harris at all these four years, she's a total unknown to me. And I actually read the news! If Biden is replaced by someone who is low profile in comparison, how is that going to look to voters? Biden is a known quantity, that means his flaws, just like Trump's flaws, are known quantities. So the question is.... can we work with what we have to win the election. Which brings me to my final point. 5) **Biden is fit to lead us because he is leading us now!** If you are American, Biden is YOUR president. He oversees the government, commands the military, negotiates with foreign powers and upholds our country's values, traditions, and honor. If our service men and women, who put their lives on the line for America, follow Biden as their Commander in Chief, why should any Democrat be less willing to support Biden as their candidate? Allan Lichtman, the author of ""The 13 Keys to the White House"" and who has successfully predicted 9 (IMHO, technically 10) of the past 10 presidential elections had this to say. > ?œDebate performances can be overcome. At the first sign of adversity the spineless Democrats want to throw under the bus, their own incumbent president. My goodness.??Honestly.... I think he's right. In any great enterprise, setbacks happen. But in deciding whether to stay the course vs setting out into the unknown, you first and foremost need to listen to reason, and discipline your thoughts with the data. And I simply don't see the rational case for replacing Biden with another presidential candidate.",Spare-Dingo-531,2024/7/11 05:32,132,69,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1e07ld7/i_think_biden_should_stay_in_the_race/,https://reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1e07ld7/i_think_biden_should_stay_in_the_race/,,,,,,,

I just read a business [report](https://www.oliverwymanforum.com/global-consumer-sentiment/how-will-ai-affect-global-economics/introduction.html) that asked people if they could tell AI from real images and it's scary that people can't tell the diference.

I thought it might be interesting to list some of the ways Trumpers will be impacted that they probably haven't thought of yet. I'll go first: they can no longer get health insurance for their pre-existing conditions because Trump repealed the Affordable Care Act. Or, they or their son is on the hook for 18 years of child support because they knocked up their girlfriend and can no longer get an abortion. Or, they don't have any grandchildren because their daughter can't get IVF.

I'm all for warning about trump, and we should keep it up and not give up about doing so, but its just a nominee win. They are acting like its a sure thing now, remember they thought he'd win in 2020 too. It's likely just the news trying to sensationalize, like they are doing with the Germany ww3 scenario thing. Countries constantly have war games for the worst case scenario all the time, it doesn't mean its going to happen. Still, I wish they would stop with the impending doom all the time. I actually think the whole thing is kind of dangerous, because it will push the idea that Trump is going to win, and when he doesn't there will be another Jan 6th. And I fear it might even be worse. Edit: Someone just actually changed my opinion about this. It might end up having the same effect on Republican voters the way the news did with Democrats in 2016 by causing them to get too relaxed and not show up.

The majority held that the President?™s communications, intentions, and even his own confessions cannot be considered to hold him accountable for his crimes committed in the course of almost anything related to his official acts. This ruling is wrong, unprecedented, and offensive to our democracy. It has been universally condemned by legal experts from across the political spectrum. Absolutely nothing in our Constitution or laws says anything which remotely resembles the legal immunity which this Court has announced, and all available evidence suggests that its exclusion from our Constitution was intentional. Founding Father Alexander Hamilton wrote that unlike a king, a president under our Constitution could be impeached and, quote, ?œwould afterwards be liable to prosecution and punishment,??unquote. Former President Nixon conceded his potential criminal liability by accepting a pardon for his illegal conduct in office in 1974. As recently as 2021, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Donald Trump was not immune to the civil and criminal consequences of his actions leading up to the January 6 insurrection against Congress. We are a nation of laws and equality, not a monarchy in which our leaders are above the law. We elect stewards of our government, not all-powerful dictators. Our presidents are not only bound to the same law as everyone else, but especially responsible to execute their duties in strict and solemn conformance with the lawfully-enacted statutes which govern the awesome powers entrusted to them by the American people. I, like my predecessors, am a sworn protector of the law, and can never be authorized to abuse it without consequence. I have already pledged never to take advantage of the outrageous opinion of the Supreme Court?™s majority. I renew that pledge today, and ask every individual who seeks this office in the future to pledge the same. Know that this ruling cannot and will not stand. Today I announce that I, the Democratic Party, and Republicans who value our first-world democracy will work together to ensure that the Office of the President of the United States, regardless of its occupant, forever remains bound by the law of the land. Every available option ??from a constitutional amendment, federal legislation, to restructuring of our Supreme Court and its ethical obligations ??is on the table. We will restore our revered tradition of legal equality. Tyrants, despots, and compromised jurists will not undermine our 248-year old nation of democratic governance ??we, as freedom-loving Americans, simply will not permit it. Presidents change, and their agendas differ, but their obligation to obey the law must remain constant. I ask every American, regardless of their political leanings, to join me in this critical endeavor for the sanctity and security of our great nation. Thank you and good night.",ajcpullcom,2024/7/3 23:35,109,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1duhce8/the_nationally_televised_address_i_want_to_hear/,https://reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1duhce8/the_nationally_televised_address_i_want_to_hear/,,,,,,,

Liberal,1e4s21r,Hypocrisy of the Right on Political Violence,"Democrats like Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi, and President Biden have been sending messages of support, sympathy, and prayers to Donald Trump since the assassination attempt in Pennsylvania on Saturday. But how has Donald Trump himself reacted when his political opponents have faced similar threats, often from his own supporters? Here?™s what Trump said after 82-year-old Paul Pelosi, husband of the former House Democratic Speaker, had his skull fractured in October 2022 by a man who believed Trump's false election claims: ""We'll stand up to crazy Nancy Pelosi, who ruined San Francisco. How's her husband doing, by the way? Anybody know?"" He then commented on Pelosi?™s opposition to the border wall, noting that the wall around her house ?œobviously didn?™t do a very good job.??Trump?™s reaction to a far-right plot to kidnap Michigan?™s Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer in August 2022 was similarly dismissive. He claimed, ?œThe sting that they did involving Gretchen Whitmer was fake, just like those who instigated January 6.??This was despite a jury finding the two ringleaders guilty of the kidnapping plot two weeks later. In another instance, just a week after a man who claimed to be one of Trump?™s big fans was arrested for attempting to kill Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, Trump posted a video to Twitter saying, ?œCAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something.??He repeated, ?œSome people did something,??a phrase many found inflammatory. A week after one of his supporters sent a pipe bomb to Jewish billionaire George Soros?™s home in 2018, Trump speculated, ?œI wouldn?™t be surprised,??implying Soros might have staged the incident. During the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021, as his Vice President Mike Pence was being rushed out with his family, Trump responded to chants of ?œHang Mike Pence??by saying, ?œIt?™s common sense that you?™re supposed to protect. If you know a vote is fraudulent, how can you pass on a fraudulent vote to Congress???While I am relieved that Donald Trump did not die in the assassination attempt in Pennsylvania and condemn all political violence, it is absurd for Trump supporters to lecture others on how to react to such violence given Trump?™s own reactions when the threats were against Democrats or even his own Vice President.",blindfoldpeak,2024/7/16 23:49,97,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1e4s21r/hypocrisy_of_the_right_on_political_violence/,https://reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1e4s21r/hypocrisy_of_the_right_on_political_violence/,,,,,,,

Liberal,1bn02qr,"The Young Turks (TYT) Disproportionally Representing Black People in Political Interviews, Falsely/Misleadingly Portraying Black People as a Republican Group (and Potentially Trying to Make Them Look Idiotic)","I noticed The Young Turks has, in the past week, released various videos interviewing MAGA supporters trying to present republicans as unintelligent. Of these videos, 40% of the Republicans in the thumbnails are black. Statistically, 2% of Republicans are black. That means that black Republicans only represent 0.46% of the U.S.'s identifying voter base. Notably, 80% of black males vote Democrat and 90% of black females vote Democrat, the largest group of democrat voters in the country (blowing out even the Asian and Jewish leanings toward the Democratic Party by around 15-20 percentage points). Is the manner The Young Turks is disproportionally representing black individuals borderline misinformation? As a black man, I fear they are pushing an agenda that is inadvertently (or intentionally) portraying black men as stupid/ignorant. I found it pretty sad that a vast number of the comments on these videos were left-wing-identifying individuals using words and phrases like ""uncle tom"" or ""these people"" when describing how ""stupid"" ""these people"" are. I don't know what to make of that. What do you think TYT's agenda is? I assume it is not to smear the black community as unintelligent. Do you think they fear black people shifting toward the right? Are they trying to convince the 0.46% of voters not to vote Republican or MAGA? Statistically, I worry that they are more hurting the general perception of black people by releasing several videos disproportionally making black people look stupid. Perhaps it will have a more unintended effect of shifting more black individuals to the right.",makeit234,2024/3/25 08:19,79,56,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1bn02qr/the_young_turks_tyt_disproportionally/,https://reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1bn02qr/the_young_turks_tyt_disproportionally/,,,,,,,

Liberal,1guzzlj,Social Darwinist Oligarchs are a bigger threat than Christian Nationalists right now,"It seems clear to me that a subset of the ultra-wealthy may actually want American society to collapse, paving the way for a techno-autocracy where oligarchs rule. A key text influencing this ideology appears to be *The Sovereign Individual,* written in the late 1990s by William Rees-Mogg and James Dale Davidson. The book didn?™t merely predict the disruptions that information technology would bring?”it embraced them, rooting for a future where inequality, competition, and instability would dominate. The authors envisioned a world where governments crumble, taxes vanish, and welfare states become ?œunfinanceable.??In their harsh vision, only the ""sovereign individual""?”a self-reliant, technologically adept elite?”would thrive. As *The Guardian* put it: [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/nov/09/mystic-mogg-jacob-rees-mogg-willam-predicts-brexit-plans](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/nov/09/mystic-mogg-jacob-rees-mogg-willam-predicts-brexit-plans) >?œBy 2010 or thereabouts, welfare states ?˜will simply become unfinanceable.????In such a harsh world, only the most talented, self-reliant, technologically adept person ???˜the sovereign individual????would thrive.??The book gained little traction in late-1990s Britain, dismissed as melodramatic and out of touch with the era?™s optimism. But it found a warmer reception in the U.S., particularly among Silicon Valley libertarians. Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal, cited *The Sovereign Individual* as one of the most influential books in his life, praising its startlingly accurate predictions about cryptocurrency, digital identities, and even bots. As Rees-Mogg and Davidson predicted: >?œ\[A\] ?˜new digital form of money??\[would\] consist of encrypted sequences ??unique, anonymous and verifiable ??tradable at a keystroke in a multitrillion-dollar wholesale market without borders.??Sound familiar? Bitcoin arrived a decade later. Thiel, however, doesn?™t just buy into techno-libertarianism; he?™s also wrestled publicly with Christianity?™s role in shaping ""wokeness."" In an interview reported by *Mediaite*, Thiel said: [https://www.mediaite.com/news/billionaire-gop-donor-peter-thiel-blames-christianity-for-wokeness-it-always-takes-the-side-of-the-victim/](https://www.mediaite.com/news/billionaire-gop-donor-peter-thiel-blames-christianity-for-wokeness-it-always-takes-the-side-of-the-victim/) >?œChristianity ... always takes the side of the victim. ??Maybe you should think of wokeness as ultra-Christianity or hyper-Christianity. It?™s an extreme intensification. ??The past is terrible, and you can never overcome it.??Thiel seems to see ""wokeness"" as a kind of mutated Christianity?”focused on sin, victimhood, and moral judgment without forgiveness. This leaves us in a precarious spot. Christian nationalism, with its regressive social agenda, is troubling enough. But a future shaped by social Darwinists like Thiel?”who see safety nets and compassion as obstacles?”could be even darker. Right now, both forces seem to be jockeying for influence over ?œWeekend at Trumpy?™s,??with the likes of Elon Musk and Thiel cozying up to Trump in ways Christian Nationalists can only dream of. Whichever side wins the most influence, the rest of us stand to lose. Christian nationalism is a plague, but if social darwinists take control, things will get truly dark IMO. They want the destruction of any and all social safety nets. The difference is that rightwing Christians want the Church to provide the safety net, not the government. The government is perceived as a threat to their power and ability to provide that, even if churches only provide a minimal safety net on their terms, and are often designed in ways to enhance their authority and can be exploitive. Whereas social darwinists literally don't want social safety nets at all... they want survival of the fittest.",ShaneKaiGlenn,2024/11/19 23:38,73,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1guzzlj/social_darwinist_oligarchs_are_a_bigger_threat/,https://reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1guzzlj/social_darwinist_oligarchs_are_a_bigger_threat/,,,,,,,

Liberal,1ce13be,The battle line is clear: will we have a democracy or minority rule?,The heart of the entire political conflict in the United States is the question of minority vs majority rule. There is a minority that latches onto the parts of our system that grant disproportionate political power to them because they have seen the writing on the wall that they cannot win the battle of democracy. They always are the most ardent defenders of things like the Senate and the Electoral College. They support gerrymandering and voter suppression measures. This is why they are so fond of saying we are not a democracy but a republic. It's a form of mental gymnastics in which they try to place democracy outside of our political tradition by placing it in opposition to constitutional government. But they are ready now to sacrifice constitutional checks-and-balances in order to give power to a leader who will crush democracy and entrench permanent minority rule. It's not a new fight. We have been fighting over democracy ever since independence. Everybody knows all the ways in which we have expanded our democracy like universal suffrage and popular election of Senators.

Liberal,1glxlb9,Another Rant - STOP EXTERNALIZING BLAME,"After the 2016 election I was, like most liberals, at a complete loss as to what happened and felt like I lacked any understanding of the American electorate. I was incredibly disappointed in my fellow Americans. I still am. But we?™ve had *eight years* to figure them out how to persuade them to vote this infantile sociopath out of public life. We failed miserably at doing the *things that are under control* to win. I?™m so sick of hearing about the things that are *not* under our control, like inflation, the economy, the right wing media, and the intelligence/ignorance/gullibility of the electorate. For the love of god can we focus on **addressing the concerns of the American electorate* as they are, not as we want them to be, instead of constantly trying to deflect or explain them away. Even worse is chastising people for having concerns. There are always going to be external factors that influence elections. Tough sh*t. The American electorate is **economically populist and socially moderate**. For the social progressives here, you don?™t have to like it but you do have to accept reality. We need a **simple and positive message that matches the will of the American electorate**. Examples: 1. Immigration. ?œWe love legal immigration. It?™s been the backbone of our country forever. We want a fair system where people can legally emigrate. However we will not tolerate lawlessness and will strictly enforce our borders. I wish we would have addressed this earlier but we are serious now. And by the way, we have a great bill that Republicans failed to pass.??2. Inflation. Yes: ?œI know the American people are hurting. The problem is wages have not kept up with inflation. [insert populist message] No: ?œIt?™s not a big deal, it?™s slowed down to normal now!??3. Social issues. Yes: ?œYeah, some of us got a little out of hand during the pandemic era, but the Democratic Party categorically rejects the lawlessness of the defund the police movement and rejects government overreach in imposing social values on others. We reject identity politics and are here for everyone!??No: ?œUhh, next question.??4. Media/social media. Yes: ?œWe categorically reject government censorship of social media, outside of state secrets and other serious stuff like that. We are not your big brother. We believe in freedom. Yes I?™ll absolutely go on Joe Rogan and even light up a joint!??No: ?œanother GOP talking point - I can?™t believe you idiots are falling for it! Rogan!? Sounds risky!?? 5. Freedom. ?œWe are the party of freedom! Let?™s legalize weed! Also online gambling! We will protect your porn! And obviously, a woman?™s right to choose! The GOP will do none of this. *They* want to be your big brother, not us.??6. Trump. Yes: ?œHe doesn?™t give a shi*t about you. He cares about golfing and doesn?™t even like to read.??No: ?œHe?™s a fascist/racist!??The bottom line is we have to address issues as they are brought up - *even if they are brought up in bad faith* by the GOP. Deflecting and pointing out they are being brought up to manipulate and don?™t really matter to many people?™s lives - *even if true* - is an absolutely awful strategy that has played a large role in leading to this disaster. We are not being manipulated into *responding* to culture war and other issues, we are being manipulated into *not responding* and taking an actual stance on these issues because the GOP knows it looks bad when we do it. It?™s not that hard folks: if something seems to matter to people, address it head on with an economically populist and socially moderate standpoint. Do not deflect and externalize blame. End rant.

They attacked the capitol of the US, killing people including police, attempting to interfere with and destroy democratic processes. They have interfered with democratic processes multiple times, including intimidating individual voters and other political parties (anyone who isn't them), commit subterfuge, and more.

For attacking not just individuals, individual right's and freedoms, democratic processes, the capitol, but also American morals, values, and freedom, why aren't they labeled a terrorist group and forced to disband? Many countries have had hate groups banned from legitimacy. They are not participating in democracy anymore. I understand again they are bolstered by those at the top (ultra rich/nobility class) and politicians support the ultra-rich too on both sides, and yes this could all be a wrestling match between parties to make the public believe in the false appearance of choice, but, why have they been allowed to participate when they actively are attacking the US, the system, and its' people?",Deleted,2024/7/14 04:21,63,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1e2jt1c/if_the_republican_party_actively_participates_in/,https://reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1e2jt1c/if_the_republican_party_actively_participates_in/,,,,,,,

Currently, I look at Apple News, BBC, AP news apps, but I believe these are all aggregates, and I expect mainstream news to be corrupted or censored soon.

Liberal,1gujrx2,AI's Solution to the 2024/2028 Election,"Like most of you, I am just about DONE with MAGA and the GOP and our gullible citizens. I am at a loss for how to counter their strategy of constant lying, so I went to AI for help. I think its response has some interesting strategies, so I am copying it here. Sorry if this breaks some sub rule. Here's my question: ""So, recently Donald Trump (the Republican Candidate) won the 2024 election over Kamala Harris (the Democratic Candidate). From what I can tell he mostly won by spouting an impossible number of lies that were effectively unchallengable because of the sheer number of them. This allowed his followers to pick and choose which things they wanted to believe about him, while his opponent had to pick a few stances and then either stick with them or be chastised for them. Use your logical, mathematical mind to determine how Kamala Harris or a future Democratic candidate could successfully counter this strategy."" The response: ""Countering a strategy built on an overwhelming volume of misinformation and narrative control requires a structured, multi-layered approach that addresses both the dynamics of truth and human psychology. Here?™s a logical breakdown of what Kamala Harris or a future Democratic candidate could do: 1. Prioritize Narrative Simplicity and Consistency The Problem: An avalanche of lies is overwhelming because it exploits the cognitive bias of simplicity. Lies that resonate with existing biases are easier for people to remember. The Solution: Develop 3?? core themes that resonate emotionally and are easily repeatable (e.g., ""Working for Every American""). Use repetition to create cognitive stickiness. Every appearance, speech, and media opportunity should circle back to these core themes. Frame responses to attacks within this narrative. For example, ""That's another distraction; we're focused on [core theme]."" 2. Use Selective Fact-Checking Strategically The Problem: Countering every lie can lead to fatigue or the ""illusory truth effect,"" where repetition makes lies seem true. The Solution: Choose to debunk high-impact lies that can cause measurable harm or derail the core message. Use a ""truth sandwich"" approach: Start with the truth, briefly debunk the lie, and return to the truth. Collaborate with trusted media and fact-checking platforms to preemptively debunk repeated falsehoods. 3. Humanize the Campaign The Problem: Broadly targeted lies thrive because they lack specific emotional grounding. The Solution: Focus on individual stories and human connections. Highlight real people and how policies affect them directly. Deploy surrogates (trusted community voices, not just politicians) to amplify these stories and refute misinformation within their circles. 4. Leverage Data and Analytics The Problem: Lies spread because they are emotionally engaging, often through targeted digital campaigns. The Solution: Employ micro-targeted ads to reach key demographics with messages tailored to counter misinformation in their specific contexts. Monitor misinformation trends using AI and analytics tools to identify and counter viral narratives quickly. 5. Strengthen Institutional Trust The Problem: Lies undermine trust in institutions, making it easier for false narratives to thrive. The Solution: Position the campaign as a force for institutional renewal and reform. Avoid defensiveness; instead, advocate for transparency and accountability. Partner with trusted non-political organizations to communicate key messages. 6. Call Out the ""Flood of Lies"" The Problem: People may not notice the volume and strategy behind misinformation unless it is explicitly pointed out. The Solution: Introduce the concept of ""lie overload"" into public discourse. Use humor or metaphors (e.g., ""trying to drink truth from a firehose of lies""). Highlight patterns of dishonesty rather than individual claims, framing them as disrespectful to voters. 7. Emphasize Unity and Forward-Looking Optimism The Problem: Lies can create polarization and fear, which motivates voters to cling to familiar narratives. The Solution: Offer a vision that is positive, inclusive, and solution-oriented. Use optimistic messaging to contrast with the chaos and divisiveness sown by misinformation. 8. Pre-Bunk Before Debunk The Problem: Lies often take hold because they meet people unprepared. The Solution: Anticipate likely misinformation themes and preemptively address them with facts and framing before they gain traction. For example, before a false claim about taxes emerges, emphasize, ""We're ensuring tax fairness for working families while billionaires pay their share."" By sticking to these strategies, a Democratic candidate can navigate the challenges of a misinformation-heavy campaign while maintaining integrity and effectiveness. Ultimately, the goal is to frame the campaign as an advocate for the truth and solutions, rather than just reacting to falsehoods.""",neepster44,2024/11/19 08:06,50,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1gujrx2/ais_solution_to_the_20242028_election/,https://reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1gujrx2/ais_solution_to_the_20242028_election/,,,,,,,

Sign up and you?™ll get a Zoom link to join when the session starts. **Training**: My call (and I believe every call) starts with a training session on how to use the dialer software and how to preview the suggested script for that calling session. This session was calling voters in PA so the callers let us know ahead of time that some folks might be Trump supporters in case anyone got gruff with us. We were advised to always be polite and not argue. **Calling**: They used a website called Scale To Win for the calls. I dialed directly from my browser using the site. I?™d recommend using a laptop/desktop for this, but a tablet should work as well. I used my laptop and headphones and it worked great. Callers didn?™t see my name or my phone number. A tone would signal that a new caller had picked up and I?™d start the script, pressing items for responses, such as if I?™d gotten the right person (the software had the first name of who I was calling), if they were supporting Kamala Harris or not, etc. The end goal for this calling session was to see how folks were voting, and to encourage Kamala supporters to volunteer. Potential volunteers would receive a follow-up call. I actually had a few who wanted to volunteer and others who said that work/life didn't give them time, although they were voting for Harris. There were a lot of hang ups, and voice mails, but the only ""angry"" person was actually a Kamala voter who was just sick of getting so many calls. I feel for folks that live in swing states! About 10 minutes before the session ended, we joined back on our Zoom call for a debrief. We also had a short form to fill out about what was front-of-mind for voters (it was inflation on my calls). Some folks had questions and suggestions, but mostly it was positive feedback. Give it a try. I?™ll be doing another phone bank soon.

Liberal,1gsoomx,Elon Musk's Experiment in Chaos,"Elon Musk?™s acquisition of Twitter was a corporate melodrama of hubris and miscalculation. Forced into the $44 billion deal after an ill-fated public declaration of interest?”and a subsequent legal entanglement?”Musk found himself trapped. The deal drained a substantial portion of his wealth, publicly tethered him to a troubled platform, and bruised his reputation. Tesla, the crown jewel of his empire, saw its stock dip as investors questioned his judgment and priorities. To many, the world's richest man now seemed outmaneuvered, exposed, and mocked on the very platform he now owned. But Musk, a man who thrives on reinvention, channeled his humiliation into calculated revenge?”not just against those who mocked him, but against the entire system he saw as flawed and hypocritical. If the acquisition of Twitter had turned him into a global punchline, he would reshape the punchline into a weapon. Over time, the platform transformed under his guidance?”chaotic, polarizing, and riddled with policy decisions that seemed less about business strategy and more about dismantling cultural norms. Musk's motivations became inscrutable, but one pattern emerged: he sought to amplify voices that promised upheaval, regardless of their political orientation. He reconnected with figures like Donald Trump, whose populist appeal and chaotic energy mirrored Musk?™s own ethos of disruption. It wasn?™t ideological. Musk didn?™t care about partisan divides; he cared about breaking the status quo. America had humiliated him, and now he would humiliate America. In funding Trump?™s political resurgence, Musk wasn?™t endorsing a candidate?”he was creating a spectacle. His millions flowed into the campaign not to champion a cause but to watch the world?™s most powerful democracy devour itself. Kamala Harris wasn?™t defeated by Donald Trump. She was outmaneuvered by Elon Musk?™s shadowy influence. Musk?™s resources, his platform, and his vendetta shaped the electoral landscape. The election wasn?™t just a contest of ideologies; it was a stage for Musk?™s experiment in chaos. As the dust settled, Musk stood apart, watching a world he had pushed toward the brink. Was it revenge, sociopathy, or the perverse thrill of proving that even the most powerful systems could be puppets to his whims? Musk?™s actions defied easy categorization, but the consequences were clear: he wasn?™t just a tech mogul anymore. He had become something else entirely?”a kingmaker, a chaos agent, a man whose wounds fueled his quest to reshape the world in his image.

Liberal,1eikytq,What kind of prosecutor was Kamala Harris? Setting the facts straight,"I've seen in a lot of comments, and heard from some friends in real life as well, opinions that are very negative about Kamala's experience as a district attorney and then attorney general. Basically anyone claiming ""Kamala was a cop"". Looking into this, I did a lot of research and wanted to share just some of the things I found. First, I think it's important to acknowledge that being a prosecutor is a tough job, one that deals with tough moral situations, especially as part of a social justice system that is often biased and unfair. I doubt there's a prosecutor in the country who I agree with as a liberal on every decision. But despite this, prosecutors obviously serve a crucially important role in any legal system. And it is really simply incorrect to claim that Kamala was just ""a cop"", or inherently or entirely illiberal in her legal record. 1. Harris had a liberal record for the time on marijuana prosecution. While DA of San Francisco, her office's policy [was to not seek jail time for mere possession](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/trump-claims-harris-jailed-thousands-and-thousands-of-black-people-over-marijuana-but-her-actual-record-as-a-prosecutor-is-more-nuanced/). Only a handful of people were jailed for possession under her tenure, most probably for extenuated issues. Of course, since then the Biden-Harris administration [reclassified marijuana](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/30/1248205659/marijuana-reclassify-biden-less-restrictions) and she's the first mainstream [presidential candidate to be pro-legalization](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dariosabaghi/2024/07/22/where-does-kamala-harris-stand-on-marijuana/). 2. One of Harris' biggest initatives as DA was ""Back on Track"", which provided housing, job training, and substance abuse treatment for nonviolent offenders charged with drug possession. [The program was really successful](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2020/08/10/kamala-harris-progressive-pioneer-san-francisco-da-column/3334668001/), greatly reducing the rate of re-offenses, and [saved tax payers money](https://bja.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh186/files/Publications/BackonTrackFS.pdf). In the end, it was so successful that other cities around the country like [Baltimore](https://www.baltimoresun.com/2015/05/14/mosby-new-program-gives-nonviolent-offenders-a-second-chance/) and Philly copied it as well. 3. She's always been consistently against the [death penalty](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/466546-harris-campaign-releases-ad-on-opposition-to-death-penalty/). As [written in 2004](https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/New-D-A-promises-to-be-smart-on-crime-Harris-2831205.php) when she was elected to SF DA: ""Harris has pledged to continue Hallinan's practice of supporting patients receiving medical marijuana, refusing to seek the death penalty and prosecuting three-strike offenders only for serious or violent felonies."" ""It takes much more than building prisons and locking away prisoners to keep our city safe,"" Harris said. 4. As AG, she created a [new division and initiative](https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-launches-initiative-reduce-recidivism) to help first time offenders reintegrate in society and avoid repeat crimes. She also [refused to enforce Prop 8](https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/harris-vows-to-abandon-prop-8/1860319/), the ban on gay marriage on California eventually declared unconstitutional. For more, see: [Public defender: I worked with Kamala Harris. She was the most progressive DA in California](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2020/08/10/kamala-harris-progressive-pioneer-san-francisco-da-column/3334668001/). **Now, who did Harris really prosecute hard? Large corporations, polluters, and banks.** 5. She [fought for big banks to pay $20 billlion to California home owners during the 2008-2009 financial crisis, and won](https://fortune.com/2024/07/22/kamala-harris-jamie-dimon-settlement-california-homeowners-big-banks-financial-crisis/). 6.

How they could even make conversation is beyond me. 2. Vance is incredibly relatable to the working poor especially with the addiction in his family he faced growing up. 3. Why this guy is Republican is beyond me however he is dangerously relatable to blue collar workers and he is very young (for a politician). The fact the Teamsters showed up to the RNC also ?? sigh 4.

Liberal,1goxogz,What I think needs changing,"Some quick thoughts on what I think needs changing: * Dems need to focus on concrete solutions, and abandon all of the feelings and vibes nonsense. I could hear it in almost every speech the last 4 years. Dripping with feelings and warm fuzzies. Just stop. Propose long-term solutions, or don't even try. The vast majority of Americans want problem solving, not an emotional bath. ""A, B, and C are problems, and we think X, Y, and Z will address at least some of it, and here's how, and here's how it gets paid for."" * DEAL WITH THE BORDER. I used to think the greatest unforced political error in history was Romney's ""my message is for you, not the 47% of Americans that don't pay taxes."" Not anymore. Escorting millions of border crossers into red border states - who then bussed them to blue cities and suburbs - is now the greatest unforced political error that the free world will ever see. * Stop marching dudes with mustaches, red lipstick, and dresses in front of voters. I believe most folks don't care what the individual does with their own time, but for the love of god, don't alienate voters like you did. That was another unforced political error. * Never again make the mistake of pigeon-holing the other candidate as a nazi or a felon, without proving to voters beyond a shadow of a doubt that your vision of governance (taxation, foreign policy, economic growth measures, etc) is better than theirs. * Never again run for president and tell voters that you want to raise taxes. Even if it's only on high earners. High earners have kids, parents, siblings, friends, and neighbors who all vote also. If a reporter ever asks a future dem candidate about their position on taxes, the answer should be ""we feel strongly that we need to get the nose of the national debt pointed back into a safer trajectory. We have a list of investments in infrastructure that need to be addressed, but nothing - no bridges, no roads, no dams, no power lines - is going to be replaced if republicans keep eroding the tax base and driving us ever deeper in debt. We're on a bad trajectory, and both sides got us there."" * Don't ever - ever, ever, ever, ever - ignore inflation again.",WL661-410-Eng,2024/11/12 01:25,42,149,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1goxogz/what_i_think_needs_changing/,https://reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1goxogz/what_i_think_needs_changing/,,,,,,,

Liberal,1gv3l0j,What were republicans like before Trump? TLDR at the bottom,"I was 2 years old when W Bush was reelected in 2004, so I never paid much attention to politics obviously. Hell, I?™m sure that even when I was 6 I probably didn?™t know Obama was president for a long while. But I knew he was president as some point and obviously he?™s amazing But 2016 rolls around and Donald Trump comes into the picture. I was rooting for Hilary, but ultimately at that point in my life, it didn?™t affect me that much so him winning was not a big deal. And tbh I don?™t even know when I started to get into politics, because I voted for Biden in 2020 but that year was such a blur that I don?™t even know how I felt. But I think it must start in 2022 when the Supreme Court overturned Roe V Wade. I looked into what caused it, and found out it was trump and his justice picks. That?™s when it really started. I began looking briefly at some of his campaign in 2016 and just seeing the lying, pretentious, pos he really is. But I ultimately didn?™t pay that much attention. I figured if Biden won once, then he could win again. But we all know how that turned out. I was so excited to see Kamala Harris running. I truly believed Trump?™s cult was dying out, evident by his loss in 2020, that there was no way he?™d win. This election would be a slam dunk and a retribution of the 2016 election. So for all 107 days of her campaign as well as every day since, I?™ve kept a close eye on the him, with each new rally and piece of misinformation further cementing my hatred of him and his dumbass followers The fucking insult to injury is that he doesn?™t even fucking campaign. He talks about literally nothing for hours and people eat it up. In a normal world his campaign would?™ve ended so many times. Need I remind you that this made jacked off a microphone and pretended to suck it? Fucking hell. I?™ve never gotten to experience it because literally 76 million people voted for him and all of them are usually batshit crazy. Because it seems like from an ideological standpoint no republican or democrat should ever get along? But the two party system is apparently so integral to the backbone of the country that we just have to push against each other for eternity?

Liberal,1gkgkby,Election Day 2024: A Few Thoughts to Keep Us Grounded Today.,"Today?™s an intense one?”no sugarcoating it. We?™re all watching the results roll in with a mix of hope, nerves, and maybe a bit of exhaustion. It?™s easy to feel overwhelmed when so much is on the line, but let?™s take a moment to step back and remember a few things. First, we?™ve already moved the needle in so many ways. No matter what happens tonight, we?™ve seen progress over the last few years that didn?™t just happen by chance. It happened because people fought for it, showed up, and stayed engaged. Change is slow, frustratingly so sometimes, but every cycle we?™re part of it. Voting is one step?”what we?™re building goes beyond today. Second, don?™t underestimate the power of a long game. The path to lasting change has always been two steps forward, one step back. Look at history?”most of the progress we?™ve made came from people who kept showing up, even after tough losses. Our voices aren?™t going anywhere after tonight. If we want a future that reflects our values, our support for progressive causes, candidates, and policies will continue regardless of the outcome. Finally, remember that we?™re in this together. The most meaningful changes come from people like us working at every level?”in our communities, local elections, and, yes, even in the halls of Congress. It?™s not about one candidate or one election; it?™s about building a movement that stays strong beyond election cycles. So let?™s hang in there today, support each other, and keep showing up for the values we believe in. Whatever happens tonight, we?™ll regroup, we?™ll keep fighting, and we?™ll keep moving forward.",SpiritualCopy4288,2024/11/6 04:33,34,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1gkgkby/election_day_2024_a_few_thoughts_to_keep_us/,https://reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1gkgkby/election_day_2024_a_few_thoughts_to_keep_us/,,,,,,,

Liberal,1gyvcys,Why do we always have to pretend as though we win every time we start to lose?,"These past few years I can't stand watching liberal and left-wing news or news content creators. By no means have I come anywhere close to giving up or falling for right-wing conspiratorial to outright false talking points, but I can't stand it anymore. I watch MSNBC and the reactions are always the same. Either shock that Trump or his supporters said something, smugness over right wing hypocrisy and cognitive dissonance, or stern scolding to people who aren't watching. And then we act and treat this as a win when Trump supporters don't care. They never will because they already believe that every negative thing about him is fake, if he does do anything he said he wouldn't do it's the right choice or a ploy, and that if what he said doesn't work-out he was misled or sabotage. We act like we haven't been dealing with these people for years. Trump and his supports will never accept a loss even as they are eating the rotten discarded remains. Even when we do win it's not like they care anyways. I just saw a video about how Trump said the egg prices would go down before he even took office (because of course he is the darn tootenist gosh golly thing to touch the economy since overspeculation, buying on margin, and high variable interest rates) and while I care that eggs are still expensive, I stopped listening to Trumps boasting a long time ago. Trump supporters are still blaming Biden, and they'll continue blame him and other democrats as long as they possibly can. We act like people aren't treating us as villains for cutting out trump supporting family members and friends even though they'll pretend that their crowd has never done that. I can't be brought to care if you cut trump supporters out, by all means it might make your life better, but we act like it's only been a good thing for liberals and democrats. I talk to Trump supporters, both in my family and workplace. They haven't ""fallen besides themselves"" since Matt Gaetz withdrew, they see it as either an operation to remove democratic/rhino opposition to Trump's next appointee or as Gaetz willingly and nobly stepping to the side so that the ""Democrat psy-op"" and ""Forged accusations"" won't distract from Trump's next term. We know that handing them the receipts won't convince them because they will have forgotten to read. When they do happen to get a win, we default to talking about our wins that they don't care about, and it just comes across as though we're living in a fantasy land. It's like we're trying to emulate them but somehow missed the point of why they behave like they do. I don't want us to give up and admit defeat.

Liberal,1d157qr,Things that Irk Me Further Regarding the J6 Trial Delay,"I mentioned on here several times how upsetting it is that SCOTUS is aiding and abetting Trump in delaying the DC Election Interference trial until after the election, however, there are two additional things on this matter that irk me further. The first is that there are several folks who plan to vote for Biden in Nov, but not only disagree with me over the fact that if Trump wins the election and we lose our democracy, that it will be the Supreme Court's fault, but they even think that it will be Biden and the Democrats fault. How is it that they are turning a blind eye to the fact that polls have shown that when folks were asked who they'd vote for if Trump was convicted, Biden, despite his massive unpopularity, easily defeats him? I mean, based off of what the latest polling has shown us, SCOTUS isn't just helping Trump delay the J6 trial, but they are basically giving the 2024 election to him by taking away the one thing that would've hurt Trump's current momentum. This proves that SCOTUS will be the ones to blame if Trump wins in Nov. The second is how there are even folks that will not be supporting Trump in Nov, but are defending all of the Supreme Court's decisions that help Trump delay the trial. I mean, what reason do they have to defend SCOTUS for the fact that are aiding and abetting Trump in delaying the trial, especially when it consequently boosts his chances of him winning the election given the latest polling. Even more baffling is how several of those folks think that even the liberal justices voted in favor of all the decisions that benefited Trump's plan to delay the trial. Before the immunity hearing, I was worried that even the liberals might've been in on the plan, but during the arguments, Jackson signaled that she was in opposition of the plan to help Trump delay the trials, and then a recent interview Sotomayor did signals that she was in opposition as well, which only leaves Kagan as the liberal justice that I'm unsure about. With that said, I'm curious to know what your thoughts are.",jonasnew,2024/5/27 00:32,28,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1d157qr/things_that_irk_me_further_regarding_the_j6_trial/,https://reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1d157qr/things_that_irk_me_further_regarding_the_j6_trial/,,,,,,,
Liberal,1btho01,N*zi caller promoted white nationalist org and anti-Semitic pamphlet on Rudy Giuliani's NYC radio show,"On 3/31/2024, a N\*zi called in to Rudy Giuliani's radio show ""Uncovering the Truth"" on 77 WABC, a conservative talk station in NYC. The conversation with ""Nathan"" began relatively innocuously, discussing the ""mass media"" and corporate consolidation. However, the caller then pivoted into a short monologue, spouting classic anti-Semitic tropes. He encouraged Giuliani, co-host Dr. Maria Ryan, and listeners to seek out an obscure anti-Semitic pamphlet titled ""**Who Rules America?**"", published by **National Vanguard Books**. \[Note: this is NOT [the sociology textbook, also titled *Who Rules America?*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Rules_America%3F), by UC Santa Cruz research psychologist William Domhoff, first published in 1967 by Prentice Hall.\] Notably, this same publisher, National Vanguard Books, was also behind the 1978 dystopian race war propaganda screed ***The Turner Diaries***, attributed to ""Andrew Macdonald"" (a pseudonym for **William Luther Pierce**, one of the most prominent neo-N\*zis of the 20th century). National Vanguard Books was part of the white supremacist **National Alliance**, which Pierce had founded. *The Turner Diaries* is notorious for inspiring **Timothy McVeigh** to carry out the **1995 Oklahoma City Bombing**, and it was also linked to the 1984 assassination of Alan Berg, a Jewish Denver radio host, by members of **The Order**, a neo-N\*zi terrorist group. &#x200B; [Transcript from 38:17 of Rudy Giuliani's ""Uncovering The Truth"" episode on 3/31/2024:](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02uSOmvy97qP6TFKWEtsTJ?si=h1u613SoQSuBunnvc19khw&t=2297) >Caller: Now, before I run out of time, I want---in order to actually understand the problem, you have to know who these people are---who the Sumner Redstones are, who the Bob Eigers are. > >Giuliani: Yeah. > >Caller: There's one concise report that actually gives an excellent synopsis of the situation.

Liberal,1c2e028,Anti women propaganda and whitewashing the past,"TLDR: propagandists are rewriting the past about misogyny - denying it happened. I'm shell shocked, pretty upset after decades of working so hard for equal rights, I'm seeing them implode in one generation. I am a het male, but I was defending trans women, and once you post links to facts and studies and people refuse to accept, there's no where to go. I give up. So I asked the commenter to at least remember, years back when women wanted to be called Ms. ( No one's business if they are single), demanded credit in their own name, demanded equal pay, complained about the glass ceiling, denial of reproductive health care, about not being allowed in certain jobs, etc. people back then seriously rolled their eyes, demeaned women, harassed and assaulted them for demanding equal rights. There were even women who took the side of men and ranted that feminists should shut up, stay home with the kids, stop destroying men's lives by taking away men's rights ... They talked about them in the same way people talk about marginalized people today. As we can all agree now, they were on the wrong side of history. Except the redditor responded angrily by calling bullshit on my rendition of the past. They said it was third wave feminism ( no clue what that is). And then the kicker - they said that women not getting paid the same was a MYTH. WTF. A Myth! I was there. I was alive then. My sisters were alive then and they lived it. They are still alive and can attest to it, as can many other women. This shit happened. Misogyny was rampant. There were actually child raising books that warned parents to not allow their daughter's expectations to get too high, don't give them too much education or their daughters would be upset and depressed when in the end they would just be stay at home moms. I had friends who screamed with frustration because they wanted to be architects or scientists and they were shuttled to ""interior decorating"". And yes, I had sisters who were paid less than their male counterparts. I remember news show debates where it was explained that men are the breadwinners and women left the workforce to get pregnant anyway, so that was why men were paid more. These things HAPPENED. They are real. I am not making them up. This is like serious Holocaust denial type BS. Like Florida under Desantis teaching that there are upsides to slavery for slaves BS. I googled and found out there is actually a movement to diminish the heinous misogyny that women suffered in the past. This person who denied my take on history says she is a woman in her 30s. She may not be, maybe she is some male who is pining for the good old days. I have no idea. But I'm disgusted. Something terrible is happening. Brave New World Dystopian Gilead terrible. Is there some Jordan Peterson for women Tik Tok? No idea. But it didn't take long to revert. Between the denial of history and trump and an 1864 abortion law resurrection, I'm beginning to think like water seeking its own level humans gravitate toward authoritarianism. I wonder if Democracy and the dream of equal rights was just a blip. I had to let it out somewhere. I had to say something. So I wrote about it here.

Liberal,1bmw5ta,Student debt.,"As a liberal what is your stance on student debt? I took a student loan myself and took me 8 years to pay it. Made sacrifices in making the payment, got a head of it and actually read on laws that could help me get out of it and not solely rely on my loan management officer advice (wanted to put me on forebearance). Question is do you think loan forgiveness is the solution or does the government needs to do more to support schools so that the burden does not rely solely on student? Maybe lower the tuition?",crziekid,2024/3/25 05:34,24,63,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1bmw5ta/student_debt/,https://reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1bmw5ta/student_debt/,,,,,,,

Liberal,1grbd75,Anyone struggling with relatives over the holidays?,"I'm (39F) honestly dreading Thanksgiving & Christmas (I have to host). My parents (70s M/F) and sister (30F) are all republican and my sister has recently gotten pretty hardcore (heartbreaking tbh - I don't recognize her)... I asked for advice in another thread and ended up getting a lot of ""put family above politics"" type responses which I found to be completely unhelpful. To anyone else having the same issues in their family, I found a good resource from SPLC. I've decided that I will have a zero tolerance policy in my home for racism (casual or overt), homophobic, transphobic, anti-immigrant, misogynistic comments, etc. If I hear it in my home, I will call it out and politely ask them to leave. And if I hear it in their homes, I will tell them I'm uncomfortable with those kind of comments and politely leave. I don't care if they're family... We vote our values and believe their ideology is dangerous. At best, they're putting their party over the safety and health of the most vulnerable in society. At worst, they're actively encourating policies that are going to hurt a lot of people. They aren't just ""opinions"" - these policies have real life consequences. It's not ""overreacting"" to divest from racists, bigots, and misogynists. Hope this can help someone else here.

There seems to be this idea that if they can just prove that an immigrant ate a cat or that something sad happened to an aborted fetus at some point, suddenly Trump will be proven right about everything and the polls will flip. However, the conventional wisdom is that Trump should have focused on policy during the debate, because the weirder comments only appeal to his base and do nothing to persuade undecided voters. Kamala baited him, specifically so he would focus on this nonsense instead of policy. So if that's the case, why continue to push a losing narrative? Am I missing something, or are these people just playing into Kamala Harris' hands?

Liberal,1gnivma,How to fight and actually win,"First ask yourself, ?œwhat is a fucking liberal???If you let them define it, then you?™re going to lose immediately. Words must mean something and theirs mean nothing. A liberal is someone who wants change against what has been. Yes, there are other definitions, but we are gonna be merriam-Webster about this. Now the idea that republicans can?™t be liberal, isn?™t true. Lincoln was a liberal republican. That?™s important as the demonization of republicans will most certainly lead into not prying away their base. And prying away is just as important as creating a new movement and trying to get people to follow. But we don?™t need to create a new movement. There already exist one that is quite liberal. We borrow it. But we don?™t return it. ?”â€?The current state of the world is that the very wealthy literally own everything. Even Republicans acknowledge this but they can?™t put their finger on it (talking about voters not the elites who I?™m speaking of anyways). Doesn?™t matter what country you go to either. Left or right, they own it. Even progressive voices acknowledge this. But they put their focus on more than one topic and then the message becomes lost. ?”â€?Why is that important? Republicans tend to be single issue voters. Dems tend to focus on multiple things but then will hardline towards single issues at the end. So the single issue that has overlap is ??classism. And the solution to classism most certainly covers almost all topics and demographics. They have, you don?™t. ?”â€?The pivot must stress classism. You don?™t always have to detail it so eloquently as if you were a philosopher being quoted some hundreds of years from now. I wouldn?™t do that, as you?™ll lose focus of the uneducated. Conservative absolutely protect that classist ideology. But don?™t attack conservatives themselves, just the belief in ?œtheir billionaires.???”â€?Next, we must sooner rather than later, pick someone to lead this. The way we do that is by highlighting them and sharing them everywhere (obviously). We all must brainstorm who that is. But it cannot be Sanders because of age. Ideally, it?™s someone middle aged. That gets young and old on board. 60 is not middle aged. Somewhere around 40 is. This person must not be elite or come from elites. It must be grassroots. You cannot have them accept from the rich. They must abstain. They essentially cannot be worth millions. ?”â€?If you did not read and only scrolled towards the end, the problem is that liberals (who want to change things) aren?™t focusing on the main issue of the fact that the elites of owned things since our country?™s birth. That needs to change and we must pivot to stress it. Progressives need to understand that a lot of the issues involving civil liberties can change due to solving this issue, and conservatives don?™t actually make up much of the country. The parties do. Most people believe in change. Economic issues play one of the largest if not the largest, historically and most likely always will. ?”â€?Edit: but also brainstorm. Don?™t just take it from me.

They'd rather have a dictator I guess and punish us (along with minorities, poor people, lgtbq people) for something we have no control over. Which doesn't seem very progressive imo. Everything seems hopeless. Idk what to do. I think our only hope is if Trump is taken off the ballot, or if the supreme court refuses to take it up, and some swing states start taking him off. I actually don't see the SC taking it up before the election, so it probably will be up to the states. Too bad Michigan is filled with spineless centrists, because after the fraud he committed there, and since its probably the most important state, they of all states should kick him off. But if Pennsylvania or Georgia kick him off, then that's a win. IDK, maybe we are over reacting, and people will turn out to vote and the people refusing actually are just a small minority.",Doom_Walker,2024/1/1 17:48,14,94,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/18vtjry/is_there_any_hope/,https://reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/18vtjry/is_there_any_hope/,,,,,,,
Liberal,1glzwb6,My rant about the Reddit bubble and things,"# **CHANGE** We can believe in Like many are, I'm frustrated by the election. But at this point I'm also frustrated by the reactions on many subs both before and after the election. ## Polls I spent a lot of time on the main politics sub. A lot of my Reddit activity was on that sub. I had been posting that the polls were showing a close race as far back as the beginning of this year. And I reiterated that point up until election day. And every time people would respond with various excuses why the polls would be ignored. And the excuses followed an extremely predictable progression: It's too early for the polls to be accurate -> Biden hasn't started campaigning yet -> Harris just started campaigning -> The polls aren't accurate -> The polls are being flooded with bad data. The NYT came out with that one poll that people said was terrible, and should be completely ignored, because it oversampled conservative voters, which completely missed the point of what the poll was trying to accomplish. ## Election Day As soon as the Florida results came in and showed an unexpected hard shift to the right, I felt things looked bad. I commented that it could be a bad portent of what was to come. People were completely ignoring massive shifts in results (like Miami-Dade). But people scoffed and literally said I was dooming. On the NYT map, even before the swing states really started reporting in larger numbers, you could see the mass of red arrows indicating shifts to the right across the board. But nope, doesn't mean much because the swing states could still be different. People kept repeating that it was just like the 2020 red mirage, but completely ignored how the red mirage in that election happened in the first place (and why it wasn't happening again this election). ## Voters People frequently posted questions (and are still doing it) about ""How do people *still* vote for Trump"". I think this is probably one of the major points that people just do not seem to get. Yes, Trump has a (relatively) small core of hard-core supporters. They know what he says, what his policies are and will do, and embrace it all because they want exactly that. But the vast majority of people vote for him because they have no exposure to politics. They don't know what Trump says, his policies, his actions, etc. And it's very difficult to get through to those people. How do you break through to people who ignore politics? It's a catch-22 situation. Because of this, they do not understand the rhetoric of him being an authoritarian or why his policies will be harmful. And this is where the left's, particularly on Reddit, messaging completely breaks down and becomes harmful. Because these people don't understand the reasons, calling them fascists or bigots has no context. They are being labeled as something for reasons that are completely unknown to them. It gives them no incentive to vote for your candidate, or vote at all, when they see one side attacking them (or what is viewed as attacking). What they do know is that Trump has told them he will bring about a change that will improve the aspects of their lives that are important to them. The policies are irrelevant. The actions are irrelevant. They want change. Which brings me back to the first line: ## **CHANGE** We can believe in This was the campaign slogan for Obama in 2008. It's a brilliant slogan because it's exactly what point want: Change. The specifics don't matter. ""Change"" means different things for different people and people want change that will improve their lives. Trump's campaign pushed change. He told people what they wanted to hear, and they rewarded him for it. And it's also why Harris' slogan was a fucking disaster: ""We're not going back"". This is *exactly* what people want though. They want to go back to before inflation and before things cost so much. They want to go back to when people didn't call them fascists. It doesn't matter the reasons for those things happening now. What matters is what the people want. Sure, she tried to address those things, by pointing out what Biden has passed that helped the economy and protections for various civil rights. But it's a horrible campaign strategy. People do not view the economy and their own personal expenses as the same thing. Ask people how the CHIPS Act or how the BBB Act has improved their lives, you wont get an answer. So telling them that those things did is useless. And Harris ever saying that she'll continue Biden's work or do the same things was incredibly stupid. You don't tell people who are demanding change (whatever that ""change"" may be) that you're not going to change. Of course they wont vote for you then. Reddit is not reality. Neither is Twitter/X, Facebook, or any other social media. No doubt they're all bubbles in their own right. But if liberals really want to encourage voters to support them, they need to stop labeling people regardless of whether it's right or wrong or true or not: It simply does not work. The last 3 elections are proof of that. Redditors need to break out of the bubble that exists here. Polling for the past 10 months gave indication that Democrats were going to have trouble, and yet were shocked when that's exactly what happened. Ignoring that did not change reality. Ignoring that people were frustrated with the state of things did not change reality. People were going to vote for Trump because of it and simply labeling them with negative titles to try and guilt them to vote for Harris accomplished nothing. Part of the problem is where people interact with others too. On Reddit, it's a lot of polar opposites: hard left with hard right. So of course it gets a bit contentious. But out in the real world it's different. If you want Average Joe to see your side, acknowledge that shit can suck right now. Both you and him probably wish groceries were cheaper. Your ideas on how to fix it likely differ, but you have to start somewhere. And just discarding him and calling him a fascist for supporting the guy who *claims* that he'll improve Joe's life sure isn't going to make Joe want to do anything you suggest to him. Fixing the problems, I know, goes well beyond just getting out of the bubble. But it's a start to understanding that simply moving forward with the same mentality isn't going to suddenly work.",SwimmingThroughHoney,2024/11/8 04:13,15,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1glzwb6/my_rant_about_the_reddit_bubble_and_things/,https://reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1glzwb6/my_rant_about_the_reddit_bubble_and_things/,,,,,,,
